An object-oriented Windows-based graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to communicate with the expert system and to visualize outputs. Simulation results on a part of the Saskatchewan Power (SaskPower) network have been presented in this paper. The restoration practices of the SaskPower network have been collected and stored in a knowledge database called case library. The power flow and the implementation risk analysis tools have been incorporated into the expert system. A risk analysis tool has been used to determine the implementation risk due to the imperfect switching actions. Using the GUI, a user can simulate a blackout event on the system under study. The expert system proposes a restoration proposal after reasoning with the past solutions available in the case library. Using the power flow analysis tool, the user can check the system scenarios after the restoration proposal is implemented.',\n",

The question arises as to how one ensures that there are no lost learners, especially working with extremely heterogeneous groups in the South African context, where learners may be from eleven different cultural and language groups, urban or deep rural settings, varying computer abilities and often from disadvantaged educational backgrounds. It indeed proves to be a very challenging task, and including first year learners from the subject Journalism Practice at the Technikon Pretoria, with the cooperation of the lecturer, the author attempted to firstly design activities (instead of using an online survey) which in a fun way assessed these learner characteristics, and secondly using this information by giving students a choice of activities and assessments instead of limiting them to one or two methods.

       " \"This paper describes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) convergence study for a highly multi-modal fitness function with non-ordered parameters. The measures of GA performance used are best single solution performance, effectiveness in finding the optimum and percentage of total search space (PTSS) covered. We developed several ways of adapting the crossover and mutation probabilities, and we compare the results of these methods with a canonical GA, a mutation-only GA, and the Srinivas' adaptive method. The results indicate that a large constant probability of crossover, regardless of the mutation method used does not provide high efficiency, for medium and large populations if covering a small PTSS. The most effective method while covering the smallest PTSS, is an adaptive mutation-only method. Our results suggest that when convergence speed is of utmost interest, for functions with non-ordered parameters mutation is more important than crossover despite massive multi-modality of the function optimized. Methods with adaptive crossover can, however, also give good results as long as mutation with a constant high probability is also performed\",\n",
       " 'Transmit diversity techniques provide attractive solutions for increasing downlink capacity in 3G systems within low-mobility environments. Open-loop and closed-loop transmit diversity modes with two transmit antennas have already been included in 3GPP WCDMA Release 4, and at the moment schemes exploiting a larger number of transmit antennas are being developed. This paper analyzes the performance of a simple closed-loop transmit diversity scheme suitable for 3GPP WCDMA. The goal is to study the effect of different feedback delays on the performance of the given closed-loop scheme. Although the analysis applies only in the case of the specific algorithm (phase-only feedback) it is expected that the performance of the more general magnitude and phase feedback shows similar properties. We use signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain as a performance measure, which corresponds to the gain in expected received SNR in a mobile terminal when feedback information from the receiver is applied in the transmitter',\n",

It has been proposed that the `plus'-strategy can find better solutions by keeping over-valued function values, thus preventing inferior offspring with fitness inflated by noise from being accepted. The `plus'-strategy builds an implicit barrier around the current best population. We propose to make this barrier building process explicit and to employ a threshold value \\xcf\\x84 to be used in a selection operator for noisy fitness functions. `Thresholding' accepts a new individual if its apparent fitness is better than that of the parent by at least the margin \\xcf\\x84.

       " 'Summary form only given. For the two terminal Resonant-Tunneling-Diode (RTD) the device functionality is dominated by the epitaxially grown layer sequence consisting of very thin layers, i.e. a variation of the barrier layer thickness shows an exponential impact on the RTD peak-current density. This is a major drawback for the use of RTD devices for circuit applications and has to be compensated by novel circuit architectures like the MOnostable BIstable Logic Element (MOBILE). The operation principle of a MOBILE is based on the comparison of the absolute RTD peak-current scaled by the RTD device area. By this method the exponential impact of epitaxial growth variations are reduced to less critical lateral scaling rules. But the design of programmable and/or multiple-valued logic functions is inhibited because the current is defined by the RTD area, only. In this work a novel HBT/RTD device is presented with a controllable peak-current density S<sub>Peak</sub>. The proposed intrinsically coupled HBT/RTD device enables a direct adjustment of the peak-current-density by the B/E input voltage and simplifies the MOBILE circuit topology. The RTD layer sequence is integrated inside the collector of the HBT directly at the B/C junction. By this way the charge accumulation n<sub>BC</sub> at the RTD structure can be controlled by the bipolar effect which results in an intrinsically coupled device structure (n<sub>BC</sub>=f(V<sub>BE</sub>). The applicability of the RTD/HBT device combinations to circuit concepts based on programmable MOBILE threshold and Boolean gates and multiple-valued-logic is discussed. For multiple-valued-logic applications and programmable XNOR, XOR, NAND, NOR logic gates the achieved low RTD peak-voltages are of major importance while enabling level compatibility',\n",

       " \"In MPEG, the input pictures can be coded in three different types: I, P, and B. The three pictures require quite different numbers of bits because of different natures of their temporal processing. Hence, an intelligent bit-allocation strategy should assign a picture the number of bits according to the picture's type, as well as the picture organization. This implies a requirement of a prior knowledge of the picture types for a given bit budget. This requirement is not a problem for the encoder, as the encoder can decide the type for each input picture. In fact, the encoder can plan ahead the types of the pictures. A transcoder however has no such a prior knowledge about a picture's type before actually processing the picture. This creates a difficulty in bit allocation for the transcoder. This paper presents a novel rate control scheme for MPEG transcoder that requires no a prior knowledge of the picture types.

       " 'The need for sub-100 nm semiconductor devices has driven our industry to develop new resists, exposure tools (248 nm, 193 nm, extreme ultraviolet, SCALPEL, etc.), mask technologies, and processing procedures. An enormous amount of research has gone into every aspect of the semiconductor device fabrication process and new techniques to further reduce the critical dimensions need to be investigated. The work that is reported on in this article identifies a process that is referred to as liquid ashing. Liquid ashing is a novel approach to linewidth reduction of resist features patterned with positive 248 nm deep-ultraviolet (DUV) resists. The lashing process reduces linewidth through the use of a second wet development step. This process is isotropic and can be continued once started. A bake prior to the second development improves process control. Various types of phase-shifted patterns have been measured and evaluated to determine the effectiveness of this process. This process has been exercised using different resists, different developers, and several different integrated circuit (IC) test patterns. Linewidth reduction using liquid ashing is controllable, does not increase linewidth variations, and can be accomplished using existing equipment. The process was evaluated with IC test patterns that were printed using attenuated phase shifted mask technology generated photo masks and conventional DUV processes. Scanning electron microscopy was used to obtain critical dimension data and cross-sectional information. Features, ranging from 120 to 280 nm in size were reduced by 60 nm at a controllable rate of approximately 1.25 nm/s.

       " 'We describe a model for simulating crowds of humans in real time. We deal with a hierarchy composed of virtual crowds, groups, and individuals. The groups are the most complex structure that can be controlled in different degrees of autonomy. This autonomy refers to the extent to which the virtual agents are independent of user intervention and also the amount of information needed to simulate crowds. Thus, depending on the complexity of the simulation, simple behaviors can be sufficient to simulate crowds. Otherwise, more complicated behavioral rules can be necessary and, in this case, it can be included in the simulation data in order to improve the realism of the animation. We present three different ways for controlling crowd behaviors: by using innate and scripted behaviors; by defining behavioral rules, using events and reactions; and by providing an external control to guide crowd behaviors in real time. The two main contributions of our approach are: the possibility of increasing the complexity of group/agent behaviors according to the problem to be simulated and the hierarchical structure based on groups to compose a crowd',\n",

One of the components of HSS is tertiary storage, which provides a cost-effective storage for the vast amount of data manipulated by these applications. To bridge the access-gap between the tertiary storage and the secondary storage, we propose a data placement technique, namely WARP: Wrap ARound data Placement. WARP may reduce the access time by 1 order of magnitude, depending on the tape device specifications and object sizes. An important feature of WARP is that it optimizes access-time independently of the retrieval order. We have implemented this technique on an IBM 3590 tape drive and have observed up to 5 times improvement in access-time as compared to other data placement techniques. Moreover, we report on the use of WARP with multiple load/unload position tapes (of the future).',\n",

       " 'The mechanical stress induced by a strong electrical field could be a significant contributing factor to the electrical ageing and breakdown of insulating polymeric materials such as polyethylene. An extensive literature exists describing the nature of the failure of polyethylene under mechanical stress. The initial failure is considered to be the generation of sub-microscopic voids, which coalesce to form a crack, and is accompanied by chain scission and electromagnetic radiation. These features bear remarkable resemblance to those, such as trees, appearing in electrical breakdown. If electrically induced mechanical stress is indeed a significant factor in electrical breakdown, then it might be expected that marked changes in the viscoelastic parameters of the polymer, indicative of morphological change, might accompany electrical stressing. Moreover such changes might appear at stresses well below those for breakdown. To test this there are a number of ways in which conventional mechanical testing at low frequency might be adapted to allow simultaneous electrical stressing. We have adopted an unconventional approach, employing a quartz crystal shear wave sensor to determine the shear wave moduli of polyethylene under electrical stress. The technique has been refined. We are now able to demonstrate that the changes in the mechanical viscoelastic moduli of polyethylene in response to electrical stress are quite complex and polarity dependent',\n",

The samples were annealed at 410\\xc2\\xb0C for several hours to simulate the various backend annealing processes. SIMS was used to measure the F distribution in the FSG film stack. We found that silicon nitride (SiNx) could effectively inhibit F diffusion from the FSG film. But this film stack was not stable under ion beam and electron beam irradiation. Plasma-Enhanced (PE) oxide cap on FSG film could not inhibit F diffusion from the FSG film very well, but it was stable under SIMS ion beam and electron beam irradiation. We also found that silicon rich oxide (SRO) inhibited F out-diffusion, and that the film stack was stable during SIMS analysis. Why does SRO inhibit F out-diffusion? From the SIMS results, we found N in the SRO film. Furthermore, the higher the concentration of N in the SRO film, the less the F diffused out. A series of experiments were carried out to study the effect of introducing nitrogen in both SRO and FSG in preventing F out-diffusion from FSG',\n",

The I/Q-RBF-EQ is employed in the context of turbo equalisation (TEQ) assisted by iterative channel estimation. The performance of the I/Q-RBF-TEQ is characterized in a noise limited environment over an equally weighted, symbol-spaced three-path Rayleigh fading channel.

       " \"The physicochemical interactions of thermally evaporated magnesium atoms with the chemically synthesized polypyrrole film in its salt and partially undoped (deprotonated) forms were studied in situ by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

Careful analysis of the <equation><font face='roman'>Mg</font>(2p)</equation> and <equation><font face='roman'>S</font>(2p)</equation> spectra revealed that the incoming magnesium atoms reacted with the dopant to form a salt. The observed increase in the intrinsic oxidation state of the films could therefore be attributed to the undoping (deprotonation) process. The interactions had also involved oxygen since a surge in oxygen concentration at the metal/polymer interface was observed with increasing magnesium coverage. From the results obtained, it could be concluded that the interfacial layer consisted of magnesium-dopant salts, magnesium oxides, magnesium cluster, and magnesium metal. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Vacuum Society.\",\n",

Although the growth and processing technology for SiC, the other viable wide bandgap semiconductor, is more mature, the AlGaInN material system offers numerous advantages. These include wider bandgaps, excellent transport properties, and the availability of bandgap engineering. All these advantages have led to rapid progress in the realization of various GaN-based electronic devices, especially the AlGaN/GaN heterojunction field effect transistor (HFET). This paper presents recent progress in the development of fabrication processes and device performance of AlGaN/GaN HFETs at the University of Illinois.

A multi-frequency multi-aperture polarimetric SAR (MFMA POLSAR) system is proposed for imaging of moving targets in foliage. The MFMA POLSAR extends the multi-frequency antenna array SAR (MF-SAR) system to multiple polarizations. Full polarization is used in MFMA POLSAR to achieve an optimal polarization adaptive to the environment, such that the images obtained by different apertures are of the best coherence that is used to obtain the highest accuracy of the phase estimation. It is also shown that the MFMA POLSAR can not only accurately locate both slow and the fast moving targets, but also reveal moving targets in foliage',\n",
       " 'It is well known that C<sub>bc</sub> is the dominant nonlinear element in heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs). To study its behavior, an analytical nonlinear HBT equivalent-circuit model has been developed. The present model includes the effect of the ionized donor charge in the depleted collector region compensated by the injected mobile charge. The model-based simulation shows that, at a small-signal range, the third-order intermodulation (IM3) of the normal HBT has the normal 3:1 gain slope generated by the nonlinearity of C<sub>bc</sub>. At a large-signal level, the load line passes through some regions with constant C<sub>bc</sub> because its collector is fully depleted by the injected free carriers, and the growth rate of the IM3 is decreased. The punch-through collector HBT has constant C<sub>bc</sub> during the whole RF cycle, and the IM3, which is generated by g<sub>m</sub> nonlinearity, has the normal 3:1 gain slope for the all input signal level. Therefore, the IM3 level is significantly lower for the punch-through HBT at a low-power level, but the IM3s of both devices are comparable at a high-power level.

The heart of the model is the mixed-mode algorithm which, under appropriate bias conditions, transforms the DGFET into two single gate FETs (SGFET) in series. The single gate FET model itself uses a new treatment of the space charge region, allowing the DGFET to be realistically simulated well into the punch-through regime. Sub-threshold and short-channel effects are included and an effective perpendicular electric field, modified by the short-channel charge, is derived for the DGFET and used in mobility calculations. Additional mobility terms can be added to account for scattering at either interface. In addition to currents, voltage dependent capacitances are also derived, including sub-threshold gate to gate capacitances, enabling realistic simulations of coupled circuit noise to be undertaken',\n",

The electrical properties of virgin material and material exposed to these representative doses have been examined by two methods. The first is the response of the material to the application and removal of a step voltage and the second is thermally stimulated depolarisation current (TSDC) measurements. The former provided data on both the nominal DC conductivity as a function of temperature and, by transforming the transient current results to the frequency domain, the low frequency dielectric loss behaviour-also as a function of temperature. The TSDC measurements included both global spectra and partial polarisation spectra. Both types of measurement showed significant differences in behaviour associated with ageing of the sample material. It is also shown that effects due to processes activated at higher temperatures can be initiated by polarisation at much lower temperatures',\n",

For such a target, the signal is much lower than for others, as there is no direct downward irradiance. In this work, a simple urban scene is considered that introduces a shaded area. The signal observed by a high spatial resolution satellite sensor over a normal panchromatic band (500-700 nm) is computed thanks to an adapted radiative transfer code (AMARTIS) able to deal with ground topography and heterogeneity. The signal is analyzed and it appears that environmental effects play a significant role. Moreover, because of the scattering effects happening for shorter wavelengths, it is also shown that a widening of the band against 440 nm improves by about 10% the difference of signal coming from two different ground types (for whose the difference of reflectance is constant and equal to 0.1). This demonstrates that widening may be beneficial to observations in shadow because of scattering effects mainly. A more realistic scene is also considered, each part of which is associated with realistic spectral behavior. This latter simulation simply shows the importance of the thematic in the choice of the band, as it is determinant to the relevancy or the widening',\n",

We propose a preprocessing of data which enhances the contribution of the signal discontinuous component over that one of the regular part, while damping down the effect of noise. In particular we suggest to convolute data with a kernel defined as the second order derivative of a Gaussian spread function.

We provide an instance of a class of admissible sets which is relevant from an application point of view while featuring the desired properties',\n",

Furthermore, the sensor oscillations act to modulate the intensity of a laser beam reflected from the sensor surface. The sensor vibrations were optically monitored using a photo detector placed in the path of a laser beam back-scattered off the sensor ribbon. Using a Fast Fourier Transform, the signal obtained in the time-domain from acoustical or optical detectors is converted into the frequency-domain from which the resonant frequency of the sensor is determined. The resonant frequency shifts linearly with temperature and, when immersed in a liquid, with the frictional damping forces associated with liquid viscosity and density, thus allowing a remote measurement of temperature and liquid viscosity',\n",

       " 'Gain-guided eigenmodes in open VCSEL cavities are constructed by superposition of paraxial (i.e., Gauss-Laguerre) (GL) modes, employing the effective cavity hard mirror equivalent for the DBRs. A generic round-trip matrix is obtained analytically for simple gain profiles, including finite mirror diameter losses, diffraction spreading and aperture scattering effects. Diagonalization yields the full range of stable, unstable, and steady-state complex eigenmodes and gain eigenvalues. More importantly, it is demonstrated that in cases of interest the lower order cavity eigenmodes can be approximated by pure GL modes with optimum waist size prescribed through a variational principle. A simple analytic relation is thus obtained for the mode waist for a variety of laterally open cavities. The theory is confirmed by comparison with experimental results. The GL eigenmode properties account for wavelength blue-shifting, increasing density threshold current and increasing differentiation in modal losses with decreasing current aperture. They also yield the correct aperture placement effects in the cavity standing wave. Diffraction and scattering losses are shown to dominate over mirror losses at small cavity apertures',\n",

The device performing this task is generally referred to as a part feeder. A new class of devices for non-prehensile distributed manipulation, such as MEMS actuator arrays, vibrating plates, etc., provide an alternative to traditional mechanical platforms for part feeding. These devices can be abstracted as programmable vector fields. Manipulation plans for these devices can therefore be considered as strategies for applying a sequence of fields to bring parts to some desired configurations. Typically, to uniquely orient and position a part, several fields have to be sequentially employed. Previously, it has been proven that there exists a combination of the unit radial field and a constant field that induces a unique stable equilibrium for almost any part. However, that work focuses mainly on an existential proof and fails to address how to compute the field for a given part.

       " \"Studies on the analysis of the effective properties of chiral mixtures have become of great interest in electromagnetic (EM) theory and material science. In general, when a coherent wave propagates through a chiral mixture containing randomly distributed chiral particles in a background medium, it is attenuated by scattering, even if particles in the mixture are lossless ones. Therefore the effective propagation constant becomes a complex value. We have analyzed the effective constitutive parameter and propagation constant for a sparse medium containing randomly distributed chiral spheres embedded in an achiral background medium by using our previously reported method (see Tateiba, M., IEICE Trans. Electron., vol.E78-C, p.1357-65, 1995). The method is based on an unconventional multiple scattering theory by which wave scattering can be systematically treated in a medium whose dielectric particles are randomly displaced from a uniformly ordered spatial distribution. The results computed here have been compared with those of the Maxwell-Garnett (MG) method and Foldy's approximation, by changing the volume fraction and dielectric constant of chiral spheres.\",\n",

       " 'Spin-on-glass (SOG), an interlayer dielectric material applied in liquid form to fill narrow gaps in the sub-dielectric surface and thus conducive to planarization, is an alternative to silicon dioxide (SiO <sub>2</sub>) deposited using CVD processes. The similar electrical properties between SOG and silicon dioxide guarantee that the SOG technique will provide comparable benefits to SiO<sub>2</sub> as an inter-metal dielectric layer. In fact, SOG has a lower dielectric constant and thus provides for better electrical insulation. However, its inability to adhere to metal and problems such as cracking prevent the easy application of SOG technology to provide an interlayer dielectric in multilevel metal interconnect circuits, particularly in university processing labs. This paper shows that a thin layer of CVD silicon dioxide and a curing temperature below the sintering temperature of the metal interconnect layer promotes adhesion, reduces gaps, and prevents cracking. Electron-scanning microscope analysis has been used to demonstrate the success of the improved technique. This optimized process has been used in three batches of double-polysilicon, double-metal CMOS wafers fabricated at the Microelectronics Research Center of Georgia Tech to date',\n",

All stiffness components, including workpiece bulk stiffness, are considered in the model. The two metrics are used to analyze the effect of conformability on grasp static stability via examples.

       " \"We investigate physical mechanisms of random telegraph signal (RTS) noise in reverse base current of hot carrier-degraded polysilicon emitter bipolar junction transistors. RTS noise, analyzed in the time domain, is studied as a function of reverse base-emitter bias, temperature, and additional reverse-bias stress. Two-level RTS with a relative amplitude as high as 100% is observed at room temperature. The RTS amplitude varies exponentially with the applied reverse base-emitter voltage and depends weakly on temperature. The additional hot carrier stress is observed to induce changes in RTS amplitude and mean pulse widths (independent or correlated), and a disappearance/reappearance of the RTS fluctuations. The results are interpreted by a model where the RTS noise is caused by fluctuations of generation-recombination <equation>(g-r)</equation> parameters (i.e., capture cross sections and energy position in the gap) of a stress-induced complex bistable defect (CBD) at the <equation><font face='roman'>Si/SiO</font><sub><font face='roman'>2</font></sub></equation> interface. The complex defect is assumed to be either a two-state fast interface state or an interacting pair of a fast interface state with a slow neighboring border trap. The RTS amplitude is well explained by fluctuations in a single-defect electric-field-enhanced <equation>g-r</equation> rate between a finite value and naught. The RTS amplitude-bias characteristics and their temperature dependence are satisfactorily accounted for by an expression for a phonon-assisted tunneling current via a single deep-level state. The model parameters are the <equation>g-r</equation> parameters of the defect and its spatial position in the base-emitter <equation>p\\xe2\\x80\\x93n</equation> junction. The stress-induced changes in the RTS noise are attributed to the influence of log-time trapping of hot carriers on border states laying in the vicinity of a CBD center. The charged border traps interact with a CBD, changing both its <equation>g-r</equation> param- eters and the RTS switching behavior. The variations in RTS parameters are related to the microscopic nature of the interaction and are discussed for the two types of the CBDs. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.\",\n",

Off-state field leakage currents for isolated NMOS transistors were near 1 pA at 50 krad (Si), but became large at 100 krad (Si). The effect of a post-irradiation high temperature anneal was to lower these leakage currents to less than 10 pA. PMOS transistors exhibited less than 10 pA leakage for doses up to 150 krad (Si). Measurements on edgeless annular NMOS transistors showed only minor increases in leakage current with total dose up to 2 Mrad (Si), indicating that the increased leakage observed in standard NMOS transistors is the result of field leakage associated with inversion in the bird's beak region at the transistor/field oxide interface. Measurements on field-oxide transistor test structures biased for worst-case threshold voltage shifts showed the transistors inverted between 25 and 50 krad (Si) for 3.3 V operation. Measurements on ring-oscillators biased dynamically during irradiation showed less than a 10% change in gate delay and in power up to 2 Mrad (Si) total dose, suggesting that for actual digital circuits applications, functionality and performance may be able to be maintained to doses substantially above 50 krad (Si) with the application of hardness-by-design techniques to mitigate field-oxide inversion\",\n",

The optimization process entails the selection of component values in a switching regulator, in order to meet the static and dynamic requirements. Although the proposed method inherits characteristics of evolutionary computations that involve randomness, recombination, and survival of the fittest, it does not perform a whole-circuit optimization. Thus, intensive computations, that are usually found in stochastic optimization techniques can be avoided. Similar to many design approaches for power electronics circuits, a regulator is decoupled into two components, namely the power conversion stage (PCS) and the feedback network (FN). The PCS is optimized with the required static characteristics, whilst the FN is optimized with the required static and dynamic behaviors of the whole system. Systematic optimization procedures are described and the technique is illustrated with the design of a buck regulator with overcurrent protection. The predicted results are compared with the published results available in the literature and are verified with experimental measurements',\n",

       " 'The quest of the last ten years for high power snubberless semiconductor switches has resulted in IGCTs (integrated gate-commutated thyristors) and IGBTs (insulated-gate bipolar transistors) currently available up to 6 kV. Both devices have inherently short switching times but are nevertheless frequency limited by their switching losses. 10 kV IGCTs have been shown to be useable up to about 5.5 kV/sub DC/ and 400 Hz. However market needs for PWM (pulse width modulation) at about 1 kHz cannot be satisfied above 3 kV DC, due to the inherent turn-off losses of the aforementioned bipolar components. The fundamental barrier presented by the charge stored in the n-base of IGBTs and IGCTs must be reduced at turn-off without increasing conduction losses. The use of a second, anode-side gate (n-gate) to reduce the high plasma density at turn-off has already been described for conventional snubbered GTOs but the technique has not yet been applied to a snubberless device such as the IGCT.

       " 'In order to couple the light emitted from a semiconductor laser into the core of an optical fibre, the simplest option is to use a butt coupling. In this case the core of the optical fibre is the same size as the emitting area of the laser and the NA of the fibre is greater than or equal to the divergence of the emitted beam. However where this is not the case and the core and laser emitting are not matched it is necessary to use a lens system. This lens system then focuses the divergent light into the fibre core. Though discrete lenses are sometimes used, often this lens is fabricated on the end of the fibre. When the lens is on the end of the fibre it must be fixed in place in front of the emitting laser using a method which will hold the fibre in position relative to the laser during the lifetime of the laser. This reliability requirement is particularly critical in the case of lasers with a highly elliptical output beams. In this case the tolerances for the displacement of a lensed fibre relative to the laser are extremely tight and a movement of less than 0.5 microns in the vertical direction can cause a drop in coupled power of greater than 10%. In this paper existing techniques of fixing the fibre relative to the laser are outlined and contrasted to an improved method. FEA analysis is used in the improved method. The improved method is described with salient features such as the fixing of the fibre to a rigid support member and the laser welding process used to fix the rigid support member in front of the laser is explained in detail. Reliability information is also presented demonstrating the capability of this technique in the fixing of an optical fibre relative to a laser device',\n",

TCL schemes examine the DCT coefficient values of an 8\\xc3\\x978 block. For each coefficient, they refer to stored histograms that give the likelihood that a certain value occurs in a text block, or in a graphics block.

       " 'In this paper, we propose a new scheme to analyze the spectral structure of speech signals for fundamental frequency estimation. First, we propose a pitch measure to detect the harmonic characteristics of voiced sounds on the spectrum of a speech signal. This measure utilizes the properties that there are distinct impulses located at the positions of fundamental frequency and its harmonics, and the energy of voiced sound is dominated by the energy of these distinct harmonic impulses. The spectrum can be obtained by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) however, it may be destroyed when the speech is interfered with by additive noise. To enhance the robustness of the proposed scheme in noisy environments, we apply the joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) technique to obtain the adaptive representation of the spectrum of speech signals. The adaptive representation can accurately extract important harmonic structure of noisy speech signals at the expense of high computation cost. To solve this problem, we further propose a fast adaptive representation (FAR) algorithm, which reduces the computation complexity of the original algorithm by 50%. The performance of the proposed fundamental-frequency estimation scheme is evaluated on a large database with or without additive noise. The performance is compared to that of other approaches on the same database.

One monolayer Sb predeposition before GaN growth and different Sb beam equivalent pressures applied throughout the GaN growth were used to study the effect of Sb on GaN growth by ammonia gas-source MBE. The presence of Sb remarkably enhanced two-dimensional growth as evidenced by in situ reflected high energy electron diffraction (RHEED). RHEED patterns became streaky much more rapidly when GaN was grown in the presence of Sb than that without Sb, indicating that Sb can act as an effective surfactant to smooth the growth front of GaN and enhance the layer-by-layer growth mode for the MBE growth of GaN. The full width at half maximum of the (0004) x-ray diffraction rocking curve measured from the GaN epilayer grown with one monolayer Sb predeposited as surfactant was as narrow as 70 arcsec.

It explicitly takes several main affecting factors as multiplicative companding parameters and estimates all model parameters by an EM algorithm. Experimental results show that the variance of the observed syllable duration is greatly reduced from 183.4 frame<sup>2</sup> (1 frame=5 ms) to 18.5 frame<sup>2</sup> by eliminating effects from these affecting factors. Besides, the estimated companding values of these affecting factors agree well with our prior linguistic knowledge. A preliminary study of applying the proposed model to predict syllable duration for TTS is also performed. Experimental results show that it outperforms the conventional regressive prediction method. Lastly, an extension of the approach to incorporate initial and final duration modeling is presented. This leads to a better understanding of the relation between the companding factors of initial and final duration models and those of syllable duration model',\n",
       " 'The goal of computational biology in the early twenty-first century is to link the various genome sequencing projects to a high-throughput effort in complete structural and functional annotation of whole genomes or biological pathways. It is, in fact, a logical extension of the genome effort to systematically elaborate DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequences into full three-dimensional structures through to functional analysis of cellular networks. The first level of the biological hierarchy is comparative analysis of the rapidly emerging genomic data at the sequence level. However, knowing only the sequence of DNA does not always tell us about the structure or function of the genes, nor does it tell us about the combined action of their protein products, which is the essence of higher order biological function. Complete annotation will include the determination of structure and function of proteins, and a move from analysis of these individual macromolecules to their complex interactions that make up the processes of cellular decisions. This paper represents an effort by a research community to define the hard computational biology problems of the future, to define what mixture of basic research directions and practical algorithmic approaches will be required to achieve our goals, and to outline the directions that will likely be taken in the postgenomic era.',\n",

The approach relies on re-parameterization of the canonical two-dimensional Gaussian distribution that corresponds more naturally to the observation space of a robot. The approach enables two or more observers to achieve greater effective sensor coverage of the environment and improved accuracy in object position estimation. We demonstrate empirically that, when using our approach, more observers achieve more accurate estimations of an object's position.

Important parameters in the design of such coolers are investigated theoretically and experimentally.

The dominant three-dimensional thermal and electrical spreading resistances acquired from the 3D simulation are also used in a one-dimensional model (MATLAB) to obtain faster, less rigorous results. Heat conduction, Joule heating, thermoelectric and thermionic cooling are included in these models as well as nonideal effects such as contact resistance, finite thermal resistance of the substrate and the heat sink, and heat generation in the wire bonds. Simulations exhibit good agreement with experimental results from InGaAsP-based thin film thermionic emission coolers which have demonstrated maximum cooling of 1.15\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xc2\\xb0C at room temperature.

       " 'Strong reasons exist for executing a large-scale discrete-event simulation on a cluster of processor nodes (each of which may be a shared-memory multiprocessor or a uniprocessor). This is the architecture of the largest scale parallel machines, and so the largest simulation problems can only be solved this way. It is a common architecture even in less esoteric settings, and is suitable for memory-bound simulations. This paper describes our approach to porting the SSF simulation kernel to this architecture, using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) system. The notable feature of this transformation is to support an efficient two-level synchronization and communication scheme that addresses cast discrepancies between shared-memory and distributed memory. In the initial implementation, we use a globally synchronous approach between distributed-memory nodes, and an asynchronous shared-memory approach within a SMP cluster. The SSF API reflects inherently shared-memory, assumptions; we report therefore on our approach for porting an SSF kernel to a cluster of SMP nodes. Experimental results on two architectures are described, for a model of TCP/IP traffic flows over a hierarchical network. The performance on a distributed network of commodity SMPs connected through ethernet is seen to frequently exceed performance on a Sun shared-memory multiprocessor',\n",

However, once delayed signals beyond the guard interval and Doppler-shifted signals are introduced in the channel, inter-subcarrier interference and inter-symbol interference give a severe degradation in the transmission performance. This paper proposes a novel OFDM adaptive antenna array which can suppress both delayed signals and Doppler-shifted signals. The proposed adaptive antenna array has a simple structure and by forcing virtual subcarrier outputs to be zero, it can steer its nulls toward incoming Doppler-shifted signals, even when they have no time delay. Computer simulation results show its excellent performance, for a case where four signals are incident on an eight-element circular array, such as one signal with no time delay, one Doppler-shifted signal with no time delay, one Doppler-shift signal with time delay within the guard interval, and one signal with time delay beyond the guard interval',\n",

       " 'Data fusion techniques are used in many tracking and surveillance systems as well as in applications where reliability is of a main concern. The new data fusion algorithm presented allows information from different sensors to be combined in continuous time. Continuous-time decentralized Kalman filters (DKF) are used as data fusion devices on local subsystems. Such a structure gives flexibility for the reconfiguration of a control system. New subsystems can easily be added without needing any redesign of the whole system. The system does not require a central processor and therefore, in the case of failure of some local subsystems (each of which includes a local processor, sensors and actuators) the overall system continues to work. The simulation results show that the performance of the overall system degrades gracefully even if the sensors of some subsystems fail or interconnections are broken. Furthermore, local Kalman filters can effectively reduce subsystem and measurement noise.',\n",

This is especially true for vision, where the amount of information provided by the sensors typically exceeds the processing capacity of the system. Rather than attempting to process all the sensory data simultaneously, an effective strategy is to focus on subregions of the input space, shifting from one, subregion to the other, in a serial fashion. This strategy is commonly referred to as selective attention. We present a neuromorphic active-vision system, that implements a saliency-based model of selective attention. Visual data is sensed and preprocessed in parallel by a transient imager chip and transmitted to a selective-attention chip.

Damage induced on the trench sidewalls from the reactive ion etching of the trench is concealed by post-etch cleaning as witnessed by the independence of the effective electron mobility in the channel of the trench geometry. However, charge pumping measurements coupled with electrical stressing of the gate oxide in the Fowler-Nordheim (FN) regime, have shown that the oxide edge adjacent to the drain and the oxide/silicon interface therein are the most susceptible regions to damage in the n-UMOSFET. Using scanning electron microscopy, this is shown to result from gate-oxide growth nonuniformity that is more pronounced at the trench bottom corners where the oxide tends to be thinnest. We also report on n-UMOSFET performance and hot electron stress reliability as functions of the p-well doping',\n",

Our algorithm is based on statistical decision theory by using a Bayesian approach. The goal is to detect only temporal changes which are induced by true scene changes, like motion, but not changes due to varying illumination or noise. To this end, our algorithm uses a simple illumination model which is invariant to common camera nonlinearities like gamma-nonlinearity. This is combined with a model for the influence of noise as well as an a priori model for the expected properties of the sought change masks. Key ingredients of the resulting algorithm are a suitable test statistic and an adaptive threshold mechanism.

As a proxy measure of such capabilities, a family of related patents may be viewed as the revealed manifestation of technological capabilities (RTC) at micro level. Patent databases have stored a wealth of publicly-held and verified knowledge. Obviously, this type of publicly-accessible and -protected indicators can be used to detect intellectual/technological capital in competitive environments. No individual, company, or country should ignore this invaluable competitive information in its research frontier. Before investing in a search for, and inclusion of, for example, tacit knowledge, embedded knowledge, embodied knowledge and so on, one must start with this verified knowledge. Moreover, it would be waste of time and effort, if such indicators of revealed technological capability knowledge are not cost-effectively data-mined prior to any large-scale research. Therefore, no patent or patent study should be ignored by any competitor with related ideas, as any patent can then act as the hidden \"root system\" for supporting the further growth of a \"tree\" and its new branches. When the full grown tree becomes visible, it is to late. Therefore, the data-mining or text-mining (and their further refined versions) should be utilized to reveal the existence of knowledge about any technological opportunities and/or research frontiers, however rudimentary prior to any related undertaking.

       " 'Multi-slice computed tomography (MCT) is one of the most recent technology advancements in CT. Because of the large number of detector rows placed along the patient long axis, MCT offers improved volume coverage, better contrast utilization, and increased spatial resolution. Despite many of its advantages, MCT brings new challenges to the image reconstruction. In general, the challenges of multi-slice CT reconstruction can be classified into two categories: the effects of cone beam and helical interpolation. The cone beam effect comes from the fact that the scanning planes for the outer detector rows are no longer parallel to the plane-of-reconstruction. The helical interpolation effect is mainly due to the inherent projection data inconsistency as a result of the constant table motion. In this paper, we present an algorithmic approach to address both issues. We first propose a weighted hyper-plane reconstruction (WHR) to overcome the sharp transitions in the helical weight. Using WHR, a weighting function is derived based on the scaled average of a set of weights obtained from multiple reconstruction hyper-planes. This approach effectively enables the derivation of a smooth weighting function from any non-smooth functions. We then present a cone-angle dependent weighting (CADW) scheme to overcome the cone beam effects of the outer detector rows. Extensive phantom and clinical experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is superior to the previously proposed weighting approaches, in terms of reduction of image artifacts and preservation of slice thickness. At the same time, the algorithm utilizes only fan beam back-projections, instead of the computationally more intensive cone beam back-projection.',\n",

This exceeds the limit of accuracy of conventional knife-edge measuring techniques and conventional modeling methods. The only true way to accurately model such probes as their dimensions approach the 1 nm level is to use a wave optical method.

This method is relatively accurate when the probe size is greater than \\xe2\\x88\\xbc10\\xe2\\x80\\x9315 nm, but fails with probes of smaller dimensions due to the inherent erroneous assumption that the effect of individual aberrations on the probe size can be treated independently.

The other approach is the use of a single stage converter (in this case, a half bridge converter with an active input current shaper, AICS). The input voltage range is the European voltage range (190 V-265 V). In general, the size and the cost of the single stage solution is lower than the size and the cost of the two stage solution for the whole power range. However, the cost ratio becomes smaller as the power increases and, therefore, for the upper side of the power range the two stage solution may be the most interesting one.

Who is the audience? Are the creators and audiences working together in fruitful ways? Pretty pictures alone will not convince users that virtual heritage (VH) is worth the time, personnel, and expense needed to build credible virtual worlds.

       " 'Manufacturers of automotive radar typically use narrow beam angles to minimize the number of detected objects (traffic signs, guard rails, etc.) which ought not to pose a threat to the host vehicle. Although narrow beam angles are sufficient for some applications, namely automatic cruise control (ACC), wider fields of view are necessary for driver assistive systems. In order to make wide field of view range sensors perform well for driver assistive systems, a novel radar processing technique has been developed which integrates vehicle location provided by a high accuracy Differential Global Positioning System receiver and a highly detailed Geospatial Database map into the radar processing algorithm. Road objects such as road shoulders and road islands are used to delineate the driveable road surface. Objects detected by the range sensor which are located off of the driveable road surface are identified as such. Relevant vehicle systems (i.e., Heads Up Display or Collision Avoidance) can use this information to minimize false positives. This radar processor was implemented on an International snowplow and results from a series of experiments using this vehicle on Minnesota Trunk Highway 101 between Rogers and Elk River are presented. The system proved very effective at minimizing radar false positives',\n",

Each estimated component has dynamical variation in its three periodicity attributes, i.e., periodicity, scaling factors, and the waveform or pattern associated with the successive segments. Earlier, it has been reported with the application of conventional surrogate analysis and with the cylindrical basis function modeling that the underlying system is distinctly different from linearly filtered Gaussian process, and most probably the human respiratory system behaves as a nonlinear periodic oscillator with two or three degrees of freedom being driven by a high-dimensional noise source. Here, the surrogate analysis is extended and four new types of nonlinear surrogates have been proposed, which are produced by randomizing one or multiple periodicity attributes while preserving certain individual relationships. In this way, a new type of dissection of dynamics is possible, which can lead to a proper understanding of couplings between different controlling parameters',\n",

Currently, these applications require a reduction of design turn-around time (TAT) for the various specifications, as well as lower-voltage operation. Conventional eDRAM is generated by placement of hardware macros that are designed beforehand. The hardware macro restricts eDRAM specifications, and many hardware macros are necessary to support the demands of different customers. An eDRAM architecture that provides only the interface component as a software macro, i.e., hardware description language (HDL), has been recently reported.

       " 'When a mobile host moves from a base station to another, the old base station may pre-forward data to neighboring base stations to avoid transmission delay. However, if other mobile hosts move at short intervals, the old base station may retransmit the same data to the same neighboring base stations. Also, the old base station should retransmit data if the new base station has already discarded data even if the new base station is a member of the multicast group. We propose the Information Exchange Scheme (IES) for resolving the above problems. In the scheme, each base station indirectly exchanges the data delivery information with other base stations in the same multicast group for efficient and reliable multicast, and pre-forwards data not retransmitting the same data when a mobile host moves. We also show how IES is efficient by analysis and simulation',\n",
       " 'A strong electromechanical transducer effect is achieved in cellular polymer films e.g. by corona charging, which initiates charge separation inside the film. In order to create an effective charge separation, a high electric field is required. The electromechanical effect can be further enhanced by corona charging in high-pressure atmospheres or in various dielectric gases that have high, electrical breakdown strengths. The effect of the gas inside the cellular structure has also been studied. A higher electric field most likely causes more complete charging throughout the cellular film.

       " 'A number of estimation techniques have been developed to achieve speed and position sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives. Most of them suffer from variation of motor parameters such as the stator resistance, stator inductance and torque constant. Also, it is known that conventional linear estimators are not adaptive to variations of the operating point in a nonlinear system. The sliding mode technique has shown promising results when estimating or controlling nonlinear systems. This paper presents a sliding mode observer (SMO) for estimating the position and speed of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to achieve sensorless drive system. The technique can be generalized to other motor drives and motion control systems. The effect of the variations of motor parameters such as torque constant, stator resistance and stator inductance on the position and/or speed estimations, over a wide speed range, have been studied. Compared to other methods, the observer is more robust to operating conditions and parameter uncertainties. Simulations show that the observer is robust to 200% parameter detuning.',\n",

       " 'Multitarget tracking (MTT) deals with the state estimation of an unknown number of moving targets. Available measurements may both arise from the targets if they are detected, and from clutter. Clutter is generally considered as a model describing false alarms. Its (spatio-temporal) statistical properties are quite different from those of the target, which makes the extraction of target tracks from clutter possible. To perform multitarget tracking the observer has at his disposal a huge amount of data, possibly collected on multiple receivers. Elementary measurements are receiver outputs, e.g., bearings, ranges, time-delays, Doppler, etc. But the main difficulty comes from the assignment of a given measurement to a target model. These assignments are generally unknown, as are the true target models. Thus, two distinct problems have to be solved jointly: the data association and the estimation.

The basic idea is to adapt the modulation and/or coding scheme to the fading channel quality, using different schemes for different channel conditions. Therefore one primary issue is to determine the switching thresholds between the modulation schemes. Typically these thresholds are fixed in a system. This paper proposes a novel adaptive learning scheme that is capable of dynamically adjusting the thresholds so as to maximize the throughput, while maintaining a target frame error rate at the same time. A key feature of the proposed self-learning scheme is that no dedicated training signal is required, instead it utilizes the long-term average throughput and frame error rate to continuously update the thresholds as the data is being transmitted.',\n",

The entire flow path network was encapsulated by the anodic bonding of the Si to the glass wafer. A diaphragm (6 mm/spl times/6 mm/spl times/0:1 mm) was etched on the Si side for oscillation.

       " 'This paper presents a framework for call admission control (CAC) in ATM networks based on case-based reasoning (CBR). CBR is used to correct the error estimation of the required bandwidth computed by conventional call admission control schemes, which were shown to overestimate the required bandwidth. This leads to bandwidth wastage and increased call rejection. A CBR-based system is proposed to characterize the traffic that may affect the cell loss ratio (CLR) of the network. The proposed system consists of two phases, an off-line phase and an on-line phase. In the off-line phase, the system constructs an initial explanation for having a high cell loss rate (failure cases) resulting from accepting a larger number of calls than desired. In the on-line phase, the system uses its explanations to make a decision of accepting or rejecting a new call. If a failure explanation is applicable for the new call, then the new call is rejected. Otherwise, the new call is accepted. The learning arises from receiving a feedback of the resulting CLR to evaluate the decision made by the proposed system and to update the explanation previously made. The performance of the scheme was shown to be superior compared to conventional schemes in terms of system utilization and call blocking ratios',\n",

For example, if a robot has a face, a human might interact with it similarly to how humans interact with other creatures with faces, Specifically, a human might talk to it, gesture to it, smile at it, and so on. If a human interacts with a computer or a machine that understands spoken commands, the human might converse with the machine, expecting it to have competence in spoken language. In our research on a multimodal interface to mobile robots, we have assumed a model of communication and interaction that, in a sense, mimics how people communicate. Our interface therefore incorporates both natural language understanding and gesture recognition as communication modes. We limited the interface to these two modes to simplify integrating them in the interface and to make our research more tractable. We believe that with an integrated system, the user is less concerned with how to communicate (which interactive mode to employ for a task), and is therefore free to concentrate on the tasks and goals at hand. Because we integrate all our system's components, users can choose any combination of our interface's modalities.

Generally, security is characterized in terms of privacy, authenticity and integrity of digital data. Privacy is a network access issue and is not considered in this paper. The authors present a method, authenticity and integrity of digital mammography, here which can meet the requirements of authenticity and integrity for mammography image (IM) transmission. The authenticity and integrity for mammography (AIDM) consists of the following four modules. (1) Image preprocessing: To segment breast pixels from background and extract patient information from digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) image header. (2) Image hashing: To compute an image hash value of the mammogram using the MD5 hash algorithm. (3) Data encryption: To produce a digital envelope containing the encrypted image hash value (digital signature) and corresponding patient information. (4) Data embedding: To embed the digital envelope into the image. This is done by replacing the least significant bit of a random pixel of the mammogram by one bit of the digital envelope bit stream and repeating for all bits in the bit stream. Experiments with digital IMs demonstrate the following. (1) In the expert center, only the user who knows the private key ran open the digital envelope and read the patient information data and the digital signature of the mammogram transmitted from the examination site.

       " 'Summary form only given. Stretched-pulse mode-locked all-fiber ring lasers have provided an efficient method of creating high-energy sub picosecond pulses. By assembling positive and negative dispersion fibers together in an erbium fiber laser and using the nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR) method to mode lock it, it is possible to achieve these high quality pulses. The main disadvantage of the laser, due to its long cavity, is the low repetition rate of about 20-30 MHz. One method which enables increasing the repetition rate in soliton fiber lasers, is the use of a dual cavity configuration. In this each cavity provides a different mode spacing, which must be a common factor of the dual cavity mode spacing. By adjusting the length of one of the cavities one can therefore force higher repetition rates on the laser. While attempting several configurations of this method on the stretched pulse laser, we found that the use of fibers in the coupled cavity modified the non linear polarization rotation of the main cavity and hence no mode locking could be achieved. Since NPR mode locking is based on polarization rotating through the fiber cavity, any change in fiber length demands a new evaluation of the locking system. Moreover, at the convergence point of the two cavities, the polarization of the cavity pulses may not match and hence the overall pulse is destroyed. In addition, the width of the supported pulses in each cavity may be different, due to the difference in the cavity length, which may cease the pulsing operation.',\n",

In computer vision, solving this problem is known as `shape from focus'.

In this paper, three classic approaches for detecting sharp image regions are evaluated. Three new so called focus measures are introduced and are compared to the classic approaches. A new adaptive reconstruction scheme for calculating range images as well as sharp images is presented.

A key component of a photonic ADC is a mode-locked fiber laser. A preliminary evaluation of the capability of utilizing this type of laser in space based ionizing environments and applications is required. This paper explains the effects of exposing an erbium-doped fiber laser (EDFL) to a total gamma-ray dose of 1 Mrad (Si). The performance of the laser is characterized in a passive fashion, i.e. before and after the irradiation. Predictions are offered to the extent of radiation induced damage that the fiber laser can endure before breaking down. The results of the evaluation will allow for further optimization of the EDFL for use in space-based architectures and applications',\n",

Al HEB mixers offer operation with an order of magnitude less local oscillator power, higher intermediate frequency bandwidth and potentially lower noise than competing devices made from other materials. We report on mixer experiments at 618 GHz with devices fabricated from films with sheet resistances in the range from about 55 \\xce\\xa9 down to about 9 \\xce\\xa9 per square. Intermediate frequency bandwidths of up to 3 GHz were measured (1 \\xce\\xbcm long device), with absorbed local oscillator power levels of 0.5 to 6 nW and mixer conversion up to -21.5 dB. High input coupling efficiency implies that the electrons in the device are able to thermalize before escaping from the device. It was found that the long coherence length complicates mixer operations due to the proximity of the contact pads. Also, saturation at the IF frequency may be a concern for this type of device, and warrants further studies',\n",

       " 'Three electromagnetic models are employed for the investigation of ultrawideband VHF scattering from tree trunks situated over flat and sloped terrain. Two of the models are numerical, each employing a frequency-domain integral-equation formulation solved via the method of moments (MoM). A body-of-revolution (BoR) Mote formulation is applied for a tree trunk on a flat terrain, implying that the BoR axis is perpendicular to the layers of an arbitrary layered-earth model. For the case of sloped terrain, the BoR model is inapplicable, and therefore the MoM solution is performed via general triangular-patch basis functions. Both MoM models are very accurate but are computationally expensive. Consequently, the authors also consider a third model, employing approximations based on the closed-form solution for scattering from an infinite dielectric cylinder in free space. The third model is highly efficient computationally and, despite the significant approximations, often yields accurate results relative to data computed via the reference MoM solutions. Data from the three models are considered, and several examples of application to remote sensing are addressed',\n",

A commonly proposed method for designing a distributed actuator array control scheme assumes that the system\\'s control action can be approximated by a continuous vector force field. The continuous control vector field idealization must then be adapted to the physical actuator array. However, we show that when one takes into account the discreteness of actuator arrays and realistic models of the actuator/object contact mechanics, the controls designed by the continuous approximation approach can be unstable. For this analysis we introduce and use a \"power dissipation\" method that captures the contact mechanics in a general but tractable way.

We introduce a discontinuous feedback law that can produce stability which is robust with respect to variations in contact state.',\n",

A noteworthy property of the algorithm is that the computational complexity per pixel does not depend on the scaling factor a. For a given choice of basis functions, the results of our method are consistently better than those of the standard interpolation procedure; the present scheme achieves a reduction of artifacts such as aliasing and blocking and a significant improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio.

With a via-first dual damascene approach, an important issue for trench etch is defect formation (i.e., oxide ridges) around vias which can degrade device reliability. The use of low-k films as the dielectric material adds additional complexity and more limitation on the etch process parameters. This article discusses the development of etch processes that meet the special requirements for Cu/low-k dual damascene trench etch.

       " 'The sub-category classification problem is that of discriminating a pattern to all sub-categories. Not surprisingly, sub-category classification performance estimates are useful information to mine as many researchers are interested in any trend of pattern in specific sub-category. This paper presents a datamining technique to mine a database consisting of experimental and observational unit variables. Experimental unit variables are those attributes which make sub-categories of the entity, e.g., demographic data and observational unit variables are features observed to classify the entity, e.g., test results or handwriting styles, etc. Since there are an enormously large number of subcategories based on the experimental unit variables, we apply the a priori algorithm to select only sub-categories that have enough support among all possible ones in a given database. Those selected sub-categories are then discriminated using observational unit variables as input features to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier. The importance of this paper is twofold. First, we propose an algorithm that quickly selects all sub-categories that have enough both support and classification rate. Second, we successfully applied the proposed algorithm to the field of handwriting analysis. The task is to determine similarity of handwriting style of a specific group of people. Document examiners are interested in trends in the handwriting of specific groups, e.g., (i) does a male write differently from a female? (ii) can we tell the difference in handwriting of age group between 25 and 45 from others?, etc. Subgroups of white males in the age group 15-24 and white females in the age group 45-64 show 87 % correct classification performance',\n",

In fact, when we use a pilot signal, both of whose frequency and time are the same as the signals which bear the data, we can divide the original signal and the multipath signals by using clever codes and modulation. Different signal design methods have been proposed using complete complementary code. In this paper, we propose a new simple method for using the complete complementary code. When we use a complementary code composed of 16 auto-complementary codes, where each auto-complementary code is composed of 16 binary sequences of length 256, we can assign 1 auto-complementary code to pilot signals and 15 auto-complementary codes to information transmission signals.

After all, recommenders; seek to learn everything about our preferences, including what we like to read, what we like to buy, how much money we spend, and what influences us to spend it. How a recommender deals with privacy decides whether its-users view it,as a boon or a bane.

BuddyCache is the first system to provide transactional fine-grain coherence in high-latency networks. It provides consistent, low-latency access to shared objects cached by peers when consistency management requires coordination with remote repositories over high-latency wide-area networks',\n",

We first show that the performance-driven multi-level clustering problem is NP-hard (in contrast to the fact that single-level performance-driven clustering can be solved in polynomial time optimally). Then, we present an efficient heuristic for two-level clustering for delay minimization. It can also provide area-delay trade-off by controlling the amount of node duplication. The algorithm is applied to Altera's latest APEX FPGA architecture which has a two-level hierarchy. Experimental results with combinational circuits show that with our performance-driven two-level clustering solution we can improve the circuit performance produced by the Quartus Design System from Altera by an average of 15% for APEX devices measured in terms of delay after final layout. To our knowledge this is the first in-depth study for the performance-driven multi-level circuit clustering problem.\",\n",

Due to the poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) of lateral displacement estimates, an adaptive incompressibility method has been developed to produce both shear strain and strain magnitude images with spatial resolution and SNR approaching axial strain images. To test the proposed approach, strain images were produced for a thick-walled, cylindrical phantom modeling cardiac deformations. Strain magnitude images with spatial resolution between 1-2 mm were generated using an array system operating at 5 MHz.

Under this new competitive framework, utilities pursue supply strategies to maximize their benefits. This paper proposes a stochastic building model of competitive supply curves under uncertainty, whose objective is to maximize the expected profit of a generation utility in the day-ahead market of a deregulated electrical system. The model contemplates the global strategy of the utility, but also it specifies the bid for each generation unit. At the same time the model has a great flexibility characterizing different market conditions. Firstly, the formulation and the restrictions of the iterative optimization problem are described. Afterwards, a brief review of the model algorithm, based on successive optimizations for different scenarios, is shown. Next the building up procedure of the bidding supply curves is explained. Finally, a case study is presented that allows the validity of the proposed model to be checked',\n",

       " 'Summary form only given, as follows. Charged particle beam transport in plasma channels is a well established technique for electron and proton beams in the 1 MeV particle energy range. To explore the applicability of this transport mode to heavy ion beam driven inertial fusion energy production, experiments with heavy ion beams were started. These experiments explore the ion optics of a laser initiated discharge channel for heavy ion beam transport. A metallic, cylindrically shaped, chamber with a length of 0.5 m was set up at the end of the Z4 beam line at GSI-UNILAC. We have chosen laser initiation with a CO/sub 2/ laser, which resonantly heats the ammonia discharge gas (2-25 mbar) in the chamber to produce a stable discharge. A capacitor bank (2.6-7.8 /spl mu/F), charged up to 20 kV, is then triggered and a straight current channel is produced along the laser path. The current can be increased up to 40 kA. A pepper pot mask prepares from the 1 cm diameter beam, nine (1 mm diameter) beamlets, eight of them forming a symmetrical cross (2 mm pitch) and the ninth is asymmetrically placed. The mask is serving at the same time as bending mirror for the laser. Hollow electrodes allow the ion beamlets to enter the channel. The beamlets are visualized with the help of a fast plastic scintillator coupled with a fast camera behind the discharge. A 2.2 GeV gold beam was used to probe the ion optical properties of the channel. Under the influence of the azimuthal magnetic field the ions are performing small oscillations around the discharge axis, being trapped inside the channel. The recorded picture of the scintillator reveals that more than one full betatron oscillation can be achieved under certain discharge conditions. The results are in good agreement with the numerical simulations of the ion optics.',\n",
       " \"An improved hybrid method is discussed, employing a finite-element method along with Faraday's law and standard circuit analysis, in order to predict the induced voltages and currents on a pipeline with defects on its coating, running parallel to a faulted line and remote earth. Such defects are a frequent situation especially when old pipelines are considered and are modeled as resistances, called leakage resistances. The fault is assumed to be outside the parallel exposure so that conductive interference is negligible and therefore the problem is a two-dimensional one. Input data are power line and pipeline configuration, physical characteristics of conductors and pipeline, fault and power system terminal parameters and location and value of leakage resistances. Simulation results show that for small values of leakage resistances, defects act as a mitigation method for the induced voltages on the pipeline. However, in that case large currents that flow to earth through the defects can damage the pipeline\",\n",

The experiment presented here employed a large projection display with a 50 deg. horizontal field of view showing a rally car traversing a curved track at speed. The independent variables included image motion and stereoscopic presentation as within-subjects factors and screen size as a between-subjects factor. Dependent variables included subjective measures of presence, vection, involvement, and sickness, as well as observers' lateral postural responses, which served as a candidate objective corroborative measure of presence. Results demonstrated a noisy yet positive effect of stereoscopic presentation on the lateral postural responses. Post-test subjective ratings revealed a significant effect of stereoscopic presentation on the subjective judgments of presence, but not on those of vection, involvement, or sickness. Image motion had a large and significant effect on the subjective judgments of presence, vection, and involvement. The effect of image motion was considerably larger than that of stereoscopic viewing. By comparing results between experiments, a large effect of screen size on subjective presence ratings could be demonstrated, but only for the video stimulus that contained motion. The postural response measure did not differentiate between screen sizes, thus limiting its utility as an objective corroborative measure of presence, although further research is required to be able to be more firm in our conclusion regarding this issue.\",\n",

We present an example of a multithreaded pointer manipulation that can generate a surprising and erroneous result when value prediction is implemented without considering memory consistency correctness.

The polynomial formulation provides efficient SPR criteria for matrices with uncertain interval parameters. To establish the robust SPR property, it is sufficient to test positivity of only three uncertain polynomials regardless of the order of the matrix. The most interesting feature of the proposed polynomial formulation is that the coefficients of uncertain matrices are allowed to have polynomic uncertainty structure.

However, to build an efficient ACK-tree is very difficult for IP multicast because it does not provide explicit membership and routing topology information to the upper layer protocol. Due to the difficulties, not much study has been done on the control tree configuration yet, while it immensely affects the behavior and performance on a protocol using the mechanism. Previous approaches can be classified into top-down and bottom-up, and promising previous works have typically been focused on the bottom-up construction mechanism, because the top-down approach has some drawbacks like long tree creation time. However, the ERS-based mechanism, one of the representative bottom-up mechanisms, is known to cause heavy message overhead. Thus, we propose a novel method which takes the benefits of the top-down approach while relieving its most significant drawback, long tree creation time, adopting the concurrent tree creation concept from the bottom-up approach.

       " 'One of the main differences between MPEG-4 and previously standardized video coding schemes is the support of arbitrarily shaped video objects, for which most of the existing fast motion estimation algorithms are not suitable. The conventional fast motion estimation algorithm works well for opaque macroblocks, but not in the case of a boundary macroblock which contains a large number of local minima on its error surface. We propose a fast search algorithm which incorporates the binary alpha-plane to predict accurately the motion vectors of boundary macroblocks. Besides, these accurate motion vectors can be used to develop a novel priority search algorithm which is an efficient search strategy for the remaining opaque macroblocks. Experimental results show that, compared to the conventional methods, our approach requires a low computational complexity and provides a significant improvement in terms of accuracy in motion-compensated video object planes',\n",
       " 'This paper summarizes an application-specific economic analysis of the conversion of discrete passive resistors and capacitors to integral passives that are embedded within a printed circuit board. In this study, we assume that integral resistors are printed or plated directly on to wiring layers (as opposed to requiring a dedicated layer), that bypass capacitors are embedded by dielectric substitution into existing reference plane layers, and that singulated nonbypass capacitors are embedded using dedicated layer pair addition. The model presented performs three basic analyses: (1) board size analysis is used to determine board sizes, layer counts, and the number of boards that can be fabricated on a panel; (2) panel fabrication cost modeling including a cost of ownership model is used to determine the impact of throughput changes associated with fabricating integral passive panels; and (3) assembly modeling is used to determine the cost of assembling all discrete components, and their associated inspection and rework. The combination of these three analyses is used to evaluate size/cost trade-offs for an example board',\n",

       " 'The fuzzy graph will make it possible to quantitatively analyze fuzzy information such as expression of human relations and mental processes. To clarify the main feature of a fuzzy graph, we would represent it as an approximate graph and extract its characteristics such as similarity and connectivity structures. Therefore we must proceed to analyze many kinds of information concerning the structure of a fuzzy graph, such as drawing and displaying comprehensively fuzzy graphs in the process. We have developed a computer-aided method for analyzing fuzzy graphs through human interaction. This method can quickly and comprehensively draw a graph arranged on a circular, a partition tree, cluster representative graph corresponding to a cluster and a specified shape of approximate n-valued fuzzy graph. However, it can not draw automatically a graph with nodes on the lattice intersection. So, we would rearrange the nodes on the lattice intersection for any fuzzy graph through user interface. This display is convenient for traditionally analyzing fuzzy graphs. We propose an analysis method using the lattice type of fuzzy graph display. Here, it plays an important role in this system. In this paper, we describe the analysis method and user interface of this system, and their application to sociometry analysis',\n",

Their purpose is to detect faults and switch circuit breakers in order to prevent the fault spreading to the nonaffected part of the power network. Modeling the energy system is necessary not only to test and evaluate the action of protective relays but also for personnel training in conditions similar to those in real networks. The model must therefore be realistic and must produce faults in real time. A variety of signal parameters must be simulated to mimic situations which occur in real networks. The paper gives methods for static and dynamic testing of protective relays. These methods require generation of signals with variable parameters for each different application. The paper describes signals used in research and manufacturing of relay equipment and for field tests of protective relays. To satisfy these requirements, there is a need for a simulator which is able to generate waveforms not only with the main frequency but also higher harmonics.

       " 'Asynchronous design methodologies for I/O circuits start from a Signal Transition Graph (STG) specification implementing circuits based on sum-of-products+latch. The limitations of such an approach are: the STG specification does not allow the use of level sensitive signals to describe choices and the necessity to use complex cells (non-standard libraries). Furthermore, the synthesis methodologies are limited to simple circuits, because the (intermediate) state graph representation grows exponentially with the number of input signals. In this paper we describe a design methodology that starts from a multi-burst graph, MBG, specification and generates modified Huffman machines (only sum-of-products). The MBG describes the behavior as a sequence of bursts and multi-bursts. The latter are described using three burst operators: OR, XOR and concurrence. These operators are used to describe a (limited) amount of I/O concurrency. Level sensitive signals are allowed. State transitions have an intermediate representation which grows linearly with the number of signals, hence not limiting the synthesis methodology to small circuits. A theoretical background has been developed to guarantee critical race and hazard free operation.

       " \"The Internet protocol (IP) can potentially become the universal network-layer protocol over all wireless systems as it already is for wireline packet networks. Such an all-IP wireless and wireline network can bring the proven advantages of IP networking to mobile users. However, realizing an all-IP wireless network introduces many challenges, among which is soft handoff. Two major problems need to be solved in order to support soft handoff. First, multiple streams of the same IP traffic have to be distributed via multiple base stations to a mobile station. Second, pieces of data arriving at the mobile station at the same time from different base stations need to be copies of the same data in order for the mobile station's radio system to correctly combine these different pieces into a single copy. A similar problem also needs to be resolved in the reverse direction from mobile stations to base stations. Solving these problems in a distributed all-IP wireless network remains a challenge. Although solutions exist for today's circuit-switched wireless systems. This article presents a new approach for soft handoff in distributed all-IP wireless networks. It consists of two main parts. First, a new design of IP-based distributed base stations enables mobile stations in multiple cells to be on the same IP subnet and multiple streams of the same data to be distributed via multiple base stations to a mobile without broadcasting/multicasting and with minimal signaling. Second, a novel IP-layer procedure performed by the base stations ensures that the data coming simultaneously from multiple base stations to a mobile station are copies of the same data\",\n",

Typical examples are the emerging broadband wireless networks for customer premises and residential applications that will operate in the millimeter-wave frequency region. The particular property of the considered reflector is its diverging surface instead of the commonly applied converging shape. It is shown that the spatial variation within the defined coverage area can be within 1 dB, provided that the antenna is perfectly constructed. It is also shown that practical imperfections such as axial and lateral feed displacement and mispointing of the feed on top of effects due to blocking by the feed can contribute to spatial field variations on the order of a few decibels',\n",

Much of the energy has focused on refining the initial efforts at predicting load instruction outcomes, with the balance of the effort examining the value locality of either all register-writing instructions or a focused subset of them. Surprisingly, there has been very little published characterization of or effort to exploit the value locality of data words stored to memory by computer programs. This paper presents such a characterization, including detailed source-level analysis of the causes of silent stores, proposes both memory-centric (based on message passing) and producer-centric (based on program structure) prediction mechanisms for stored data values, introduces the concept of silent stores and new definitions of multiprocessor false sharing based on these observations, and suggests new techniques for aligning cache coherence protocols and microarchitectural store handling techniques to exploit the value locality of stores. We find that realistic implementations of these techniques can significantly reduce multiprocessor data bus traffic and are more effective at reducing address bus traffic than the addition of Exclusive state to a MS I coherence protocol. We also show that squashing of silent stores can provide uniprocessor speedups greater than the addition of store-to-load forwarding',\n",

       " 'Electromigration behaviour in W-plug/metal stripe structures is different from conventional metal-strip structures because there is a blocking boundary formed by the immobile W-plug in the contact/via. Electromigration failures occur more readily close to the W-plug than in metal-strip structures because metal ions are forced away from the contacts/vias by electric current, blocking the contacts/vias area. Several works have reported electromigration lifetime of multiple level interconnects to be influenced by the presence of a reservoir around the contacts/vias. Reservoirs are metal parts that are not or are hardly conducting current that act as a source to provide atoms for the area around the blocking boundary where the atoms migrate away due to the electric current. Interconnect lifetime can be prolonged by using the reservoirs, called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9creservoir effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 2D simulation of the effects of reservoirs has been performed. The stress build-up during electromigration in the contact area can be simulated for several configurations, separating the effects of overlap, total reservoir area, the reservoir layout directions (vertical and horizontal), number of contacts/vias and contact/via placement. It is very useful for IC design rules to estimate which parameters are important for IC reliability. In this study, we considered the critical stress that the metal line can sustain before void formation as failure criterion.

To test and calibrate instruments for space research applications, especially for experiments investigating the composition of heliospheric plasma, we have developed an electron cyclotron resonance ion source (ECRIS), which operates at 2.45 GHz using only permanent magnets to contain the plasma. The solar wind plasma flow typically contains elements with solar composition with the more abundant species having atomic masses from 1 amu (hydrogen) to 56 amu (iron). The most abundant species, up to Mg, are mostly stripped to the K-shell in the solar wind (e.g. oxygen occurs as O/sup 6+/) and iron quite frequently appears in the form of Fe/sup 16+/. The ECRIS contains an autonomous six-port reflectometer and impedance matching system, controlling the microwave heating process used for electron heating. The system provides important information on the characteristic impedance of the microwave load. In order to better understand the performance of our ECR ion source and to carry out technical improvements we have also established a plasma model solving the ion balance equations considering ionization, recombination and particle loss processes in the ion source. The combination of this plasma model with the data from the microwave process allows the determination of the source parameters such as ion confinement time, charge state distribution, density and temperature of the electrons. Experimental results as well as results from the plasma model calculations will be presented.',\n",

This method includes conductor sag, nonuniform pollution, and variable capacitance. This algorithm can be used to predict dry band arcing in fiber-optic cables\",\n",
       " 'Autonomous vehicle systems have been the topic of much research due to their ability to perform dangerous, repetitive and automated tasks in remote or hazardous environments. The potential for multi-vehicle systems cooperating together to accomplish given tasks is starting to draw together researchers from several fields, including robotics, control systems, and computer science. Multiple vehicles can be more effective than a single one, for example in information gathering tasks. By spreading out over the terrain to be searched, a cluster of autonomous helicopters, for example, can locate a target quite rapidly, or a group of coordinated autonomous underwater vehicles can search a coastal area for mines. In other cases, the coordinated operation of multiple vehicles can provide new capabilities. This is the case, for example, of the PATH strategy of platooning several vehicles as they travel along the highway, which may yield up to a four-fold increase in transportation capacity while enhancing safety. Another example is the Mobile Offshore Base, where semi-submersible modules are aligned to form a military base and runway at sea. The unprecedented length of the at-sea runway (up to a mile long) warrants the use of several modules. In each of these cases, there is a need for inter-vehicle communications so that each vehicle can know the status of the operation, the position of its counterparts, and whether the specific mission goals have changed. Thus the control and communication problems become inexorably tied. However, few results are available to analyze performance and stability of a closed loop system where some of the loops are closed by communicated variables. Using the above examples as a motivation, this paper examines emerging results in networked multi-vehicle systems. Recent work has taken many different approaches, such as hybrid systems, distributed control, differential games, control architectures, and artificial intelligence. The focus of this paper is on the control systems perspective. We attempt to present some current issues common to networked multi-vehicle systems, and to show how they have been solved to date in the perspective of the case studies',\n",

One of the major changes in philosophy that lean manufacturing brings is the \"pull system\". The \"pull system\" has build operations set up such that the time to complete each operation is defined by the rate of customer demand.

       " 'The paper examines singular value decomposition (SVD) for the estimation of harmonics in signals in the presence of high noise. The proposed approach results in a linear least squares method. The methods developed for locating the frequencies as closely spaced sinusoidal signals are appropriate tools for the investigation of power system signals containing harmonics and interharmonics differing significantly in their multiplicity. The SVD approach is a numerical algorithm to calculate the linear least squares solution. The methods can also be applied for frequency estimation of heavy distorted periodical signals. To investigate the methods several experiments have been performed using simulated signals and the waveforms of a frequency converter current. For comparison, similar experiments have been repeated using the FFT with the same number of samples and sampling period. The comparison has proved the superiority of SVD for signals buried in the noise. However, the SVD computation is much more complex than FFT and requires more extensive mathematical manipulations',\n",
       " 'Accurate measurements of the magnetic AC loss in short samples of conductor are essential for the design of superconducting power devices and guide the development of superconducting wire with low AC losses. The authors report quantitative AC loss measurements at power frequencies at 77 K obtained with a Hall sensor magnetometer (HSM) using a calibration method which involves assumptions about the current distribution within the sample. The samples included strips of pure silver and multi-filamentary Bi-2223 tapes. A comparison using AC susceptometry and their Hall sensor magnetometer technique shows good agreement between the two methods for both the HTS and silver tape samples. In the case of the silver tapes the results also agree with the predicted power loss. AC susceptometer measurements were made using a pick-up coil enclosing the entire sample so that the global magnetic moment was measured, including any effects of the sample ends. The HSM results are unaffected by sample end-currents. The comparison confirms the accuracy of the calibrated HSM technique',\n",

Schottky barrier type devices were fabricated on low grade, 5\\xc3\\x975\\xc3\\x975 mm<sup>3</sup>, CdZnTe (CZT) crystals for radiation spectrometers. Ohmic contacts were applied by alloying indium metal onto CZT surfaces. Vacuum evaporated gold metal provided the rectifying contact. All diodes showed good rectification. Schottky barrier heights were calculated using IN measurements and barrier heights were determined to be 0.99 eV for air cleaved and 1.04 eV for methanol/bromine etched surfaces. Photoresponse measurements revealed bulk band gap value around E<sub>g</sub>=1.51 eV corresponding to a Zn molar percentage of 6.3% in the CZT. Free carrier concentration was measured using C-V measurements on Schottky diodes and found to vary between mid 10<sup>11</sup>-10<sup>12</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> in the bulk CZT. Radiation spectra were collected with Schottky diodes, at 100 V bias, using an Am-241 source. Schottky diodes prepared on low grade CZT material showed reasonable detector performance with photo peak resolution of 19% and a charge collection efficiency of 31%. Comparison is drawn between Au-CZT-Au and Au-CZT-In devices. It is found that the operation of these detectors is sensitive to chemical surface preparation of the raw CZT material prior to contact application, and to exposed surface passivation',\n",

       " \"Summary form only given, as follows. The operating regime (stationary, self-modulated, or chaotic) of a relativistic backward-wave oscillator (BWO) depends on how much the generators operating current exceeds the starting current. A BWO in the self-modulation or chaotic mode can, upon a lapse of transit time generate a train of short microwave radiation spikes with a power level even higher than that in the stationary mode. For an oscillator pertaining to the Ka frequency band (38-GHz), the characteristic value of transit time lies in the range of hundreds of picoseconds. So, even 5 ns width beam current is enough for excitation of the train of subnanosecond microwave spikes. Practical experimental realization of the non-stationary generation regime of the microwave device was performed by invoking a compact high-current electron accelerator (/spl sim/200 to 250 keV, /spl sim/1.5 kA) built around a RADAN-303B pulser equipped with a subnanosecond peaker (slicer). The device features a smoothly controllable wavefront risetime (0.3-1.5 ns), and an accelerating-voltage pulse duration (0.5-5) ns. To attain self-modulation or chaotic regime for the beam current being constant, the ratio (operating current/starting current) was varied based on the strong dependence of a BWO's starting current from the length of the slow-wave system. The report presents the comparison of experimental results and the data of numerical PIC-simulations that, for example, shows a different nature of modulation of the BWO microwave pulse generated at various magnetic fields applied for transportation of an electron beam.\",\n",

Our main goal is to explore hierarchical modeling as a basis for designing more efficient methods for model construction and usage. As a case study we focus on indoor robot navigation and show how this framework can be used to learn a hierarchy of models of the environment at different levels of spatial abstraction. We introduce the idea of model reuse that can be used to combine already learned models into a larger model. We describe an extension of the HHMM model to includes actions, which we call hierarchical POMDPs, and describe a modified hierarchical Baum-Welch algorithm to learn these models. We train different families of hierarchical models for a simulated and a real world corridor environment and compare them with the standard \"flat\" representation of the same environment. We show that the hierarchical POMDP approach, combined with model reuse, allows learning hierarchical models that fit the data better and train faster than flat models.',\n",
       " \"One of the most contentious economic issues regarding nonutility generation (NUG) is the price that a utility has to pay to an IPP for the energy it receives on a short-term basis. When an IPP provides energy to the utility at short notice, existing utility generation schedules are modified or adjusted to accommodate the incoming energy, and such accommodations may not lead to optimum system operation. Thus, there arises a need for the development of a suitable algorithm that can be utilized to incorporate IPP energy in the utility's short-term scheduling in an optimal manner. An algorithm, illustrated in this paper, can be used for short term rescheduling of the utility generation and also for evaluation of the avoided operating cost (AOC) due to the purchase of IPP energy by the utility. The AOC is the purchase price that utility pays to the IPP in short term in exchange of the energy. The effect of transmission losses is considered in the proposed algorithm for evaluating the AOC. A deterministic criterion is utilized to maintain the reliability of the utility generation system at a desired level. An example system is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the algorithm. Studies such as those illustrated in the paper can be expected to provide power system planners with a better understanding of the effect of IPP energy inclusion in the short term operation of a utility. Sensitivity studies, similar to those illustrated in the paper, can be utilized to estimate the savings in the running cost incurred by a utility when it buys electrical energy from NUG\",\n",
       " 'Normally, it is difficult to isolate and identify the root cause for sort failures, especially for functional failures. This problem is worst for the wafer foundry because of the limited information on the product from customer. Sort test failures are generally analysed by either a correlation study between yield and electrical test (ET) data on the ET structure in a scribe line or a fault isolation technique. The yield correlation method is not as efficient because of the complicated sort test, the limited electrical data (usually only a few sites for production wafers), and the variation of yield patterns and ET behaviour among wafers and lots. The fault isolation techniques may not be able to capture the failure defect, especially for functional failures. One of the major limitations for yield analysis is the irregular yield pattern and its variation among wafers and lots. An irregular yield pattern means a correspondingly similar irregular ET data pattern for those failure-related parameters. In other words, those failure-related ET parameters should have higher correlation with the yield map than the rest of parameters. Thus, based on the quantitative calculation of the correlation between the maps of failure bins and the ET parameters, those ET parameters with high correlation can be identified and reasonably believed to be failure-related. In this paper, the pattern correlation method is introduced and applied for a true case of functional failure with via issue',\n",

In this work, the authors present a new transistor sizing rule for long interconnect buffers. It is shown how transmission line properties of long interconnects alter the behaviour of the CMOS buffer, forcing transistors to work mainly in linear mode rather than in saturation as is usually assumed. This unusual condition leads to strong mismatching between predicted and actual driver output impedance if conventional sizing rules are used. The proposed sizing rule allows true line matching to be achieved thus either minimizing delay or preserving signal integrity',\n",

Watson, \"Smooth regression analysis,\" Sankhya Series A, vol. 26, p. 101-16 (1964) is a classical nonparametric estimator for this problem. Since the true scene in many applications contains abrupt changes between pixels of different types, a modification of the NW estimator is needed. In the data the authors study, the characteristics of each pixel are given as a function of time. This means that a curve of data points is observed at each pixel. Utilizing this time information, the NW weights can be modified to obtain a weighted average over pixels with the same true value. Theoretical results showing the estimator\\'s properties are developed. Several parameters play an important role for the restoration result. Practical guidelines are given for how these parameters can be selected. Finally, the authors demonstrate how the method can be successfully applied both to artificial data and Magnetic Resonance Images.',\n",

Thus, these fuzzy systems are constructed by many if-then rules. Next, we derive the conditions to reduce the number of rules represented in terms of LMIs. The main idea is to find a structure of if-then rules of the reduced model that agrees well with the dynamics of the original model. Furthermore, we estimate the lower bound of the norm of model uncertainty of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system that can cover the reduction error. Finally, we illustrate an example of model reduction and robust control for a nonlinear system',\n",

It has been long suspected that space charge might be critically involved in local dielectric breakdown or tree initiation. It is widely accepted that space charge is formed under dc stress in dielectrics. The author demonstrated a hypothetical space charge-dominant model for tree initiation in 1979 in Japanese and in 1991 in English, and proposed that charge can be accumulated inside polymer dielectrics near the divergent high field region even under ac stress. The model consists of a charge injection and extraction process, a charge trapping and space-charge forming process, a polymer scission process due to high energy injected and extracted electrons, an oxidation process, an electric field enhancement process, and a tree initiation process. The author explains his hypothetical space charge dominant model for tree initiation, various relevant phenomena and data that could prove the validity of the model, tries to interpret several recently discovered phenomena with his model, and reevaluates it as compared with modern concepts for tree initiation',\n",

The design is current dominated, with solid circular cross-section insulated copper conductors located within a circular laminated iron core. The design produces a field of 0.96 T at the maximum beam envelope of 12 cm. The magnet has a short length relative to its bore, and a small number of turns in order to minimize inductance, thus allowing high currents at modest voltage. A conductor diameter is chosen to minimize the combination of resistive and eddy current losses in the magnet coils, within limits of existing fabrication equipment. Higher order multipole field components sum to 0.06% B<sub>2</sub> @ 10 cm radius. Coils are fabricated using a wind/stretch technique to produce straight and accurately located conductor runs while preserving the integrity of the polymer insulation. Coils are wound in a \"single layer/double pancake\" style to place all conductor runs at the same radius, yet avoid \"stranded\" conductors at the poles. The beamtube is a separate composite stainless steel/fiberglass epoxy beam tube for the entire magnetic transport line. This minimizes eddy current losses in the vacuum system, both in the midsection of the magnets and at the magnet ends, where thick flanges would normally be present',\n",

The undesirable discharge is referred to as global breakdown. This is a serious problem, with consequences not only for display quality, but also for product reliability. The mechanism of the global breakdown was examined experimentally using a surface electrometer and theoretically using plasma simulation. From these examinations, the global breakdown mechanism was clarified as follows. Global breakdown was accompanied by charge separation in the horizontal direction of the panel. This charge separation was caused by electron transport downward in the panel during the address discharge. The electron transport formed a negative wall charge on the phosphor surface. When the wall voltage exceeded the insulation voltage of the protective layer, global breakdown occurred. Furthermore, it was clarified that increasing the front dielectric thickness or reducing the back dielectric thickness could suppress the electron transport during the address discharge. These optimizations of cell geometry could eliminate the global breakdown. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.',\n",

In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we employ an evolutionary-based learning algorithm as a proxy for trial-and-error sensorimotor development in young infants.

       " 'A sequence of Lank-Reed-Pollon (1973) frequency estimates provides a kind of frequency history of a signal. Each LRP frequency estimate represents the \"composite frequency\" of the signal during the time interval over which it was computed. Sequences of LRP frequency estimates (computed over signal segments that may be non-overlapping and separated in time) can be useful for detection of \"narrowband sinusoidal events\" (such as line and register signals in voice channels, or FSK T.30 facsimile preambles) and for \"coarse classification\" of \"wideband\" sinusoidally modulated signals (e.g., QAM signals). Such detections can be regarded as \"tipoffs\" to processors that perform more computationally intensive, signal-specific functions. At low signal-to-noise ratios, LRP frequency estimates for narrow band signals are superior to those obtained from a conventional frequency discriminator, since the LRP averaging process improves the signal-to-noise ratio prior to computing phase. Also, detections of events at different frequencies are more efficient using LRP frequency estimates, since only a single LRP estimate is required during each selected interval, rather than a bank of filters, one for each frequency.',\n",

For redundant (parallel) components, using the average component failure rates gives erroneous results. The effect of time-varying failure rates is discussed for adverse weather and for component aging. A primary-selective supply is used to introduce the phenomena. In particular, adverse weather is shown to significantly affect the interruption frequency. Both adverse weather and component aging require additional data collection efforts.

       " 'Closed-loop fast power control algorithms in a WCDMA system is discussed, dealing also with the special requirements set by using these algorithms when the mobile station is connected to more than one base station, i.e. in soft handover. The starting point for the discussion is the SIR-based algorithm, where the reliability of the decrease/increase-power command is evaluated from the SIR level. This algorithm was also the basis for 3GPP standardization work for WCDMA. A new method for establishing the reliability of the TPC command is introduced, where the soft symbol of the TCP command itself is directly used as a reliability indicator. In addition to the new reliability estimation, the concept of parallel use of TPC algorithms is presented, with a new TPC algorithm based on integrating TPC commands over a period of a few slots. The results show that the soft symbol reliability estimation decreases the Tx power levels with 0.5 dB, thus providing a useful capacity gain. The parallel use of 2 to 4 algorithms is also shown to decrease the sensitivity of the algorithms to the algorithm thresholds used, and thus increase the feasibility of the algorithms in a real-world network. The soft symbol reliability estimation for closed-loop power control was accepted by the 3GPP as a part of the WCDMA standard',\n",
       " 'This paper presents field test measurement results from a postdetection RAKE receiver system using a time-window control loop (TWCL). TWCL is a code synchronization scheme, and its performance with delay paths is better than the performance, in terms of acquisition and tracking, without delay paths because of the path-diversity effect. This receiver is suitable for systems that use short spreading codes such as wireless local area networks because it employs a matched filter for despreading. The RAKE method is a simple integral demodulation method used to combine correlation peaks including delay paths in a time window, and two-branch-antenna combining diversity is available. A field test is implemented while walking in an urban area, including the no-line-of-sight situation, taking into consideration microcellular systems. The results show that when the bit error rate is 10<sup>-3</sup> and the spreading-chip rate is 4.096 Mchip/s, path-diversity gain from the theoretical differential quadrature phase-shift keying value is more than 12 dB without antenna diversity. This path-diversity gain value corresponds to a path-diversity reception gain of between two and three. Using two-branch-antenna diversity, the total of path- and antenna-diversity gain is up to 18 dB in the no-line-of-sight situation. From the above results, it is clear that this RAKE receiver is effective even in the no-line-of-sight situation and that TWCL provides good performance under the given field conditions',\n",

In this paper, two new architectures for fully serial multiplication are presented. To the best of our knowledge, the first structure is the first fully serial multiplier reported in the literature with comparable performance-in terms of speed-to existing serial-parallel multipliers. The second structure requires an extra multiplexer in the clock path thus making it slower, but has the merit of reducing the latency of the multiplier. Both structures are systolic and need near communication links only.

Temporally persistent objects are then extracted from the collection of spots, and their spatio-temporal behavior represented as intensity and size time series. Users define a query in terms of a model of spatio-temporal behaviors through a Web-based interface.

These analysis methods should be able to model systems with three phase wires, four wires (three phase and a neutral/or ground wire), five wires (three phase wires, a neutral wire, and a ground wire), single and double phase circuits, grounding and bonding points, grounding systems, etc. This article presents a method with these capabilities. An additional feature of the method is that the power system component models are physically based, i.e., the model retains the physical construction of the component as opposed to being represented with an abstract mathematical equivalent. A physically based model and analysis procedure provides the means to expose the interrelationship between the physical parameters (i.e., grounding system design, size of neutral, etc.) and power quality.

The speaker distribution is modeled by the basis functions. To assess the efficiency of the basis functions, we performed speaker classification experiments and compared our results with the conventional Fourier-basis.

       " 'The current Internet service provider market does not offer different types of service plans for Internet access. The predominant pricing plan is a flat-rated plan. Since the number of new Internet users is still growing very fast, there is no real competition in the Internet market. Consequently, there is no incentive for Internet service providers (ISPs) to focus on certain user groups by offering more attractive pricing plans in order to differentiate themselves. However, as soon as the number of new Internet users stagnates, ISPs have to specialize on certain market segments. Then, the question raises of what is an attractive service plan that is attractive for users, but allows ISPs to build a sustainable business. Based on empirical results of the INDEX project, we discuss a service plan for Internet access that might be appreciated by Internet users as well as by ISPs. This service plan combines the advantages of flat-rate pricing and usage-based pricing. Using this service plan, users will benefit by receiving a basic service, but are given the choice of higher quality whenever they demand. From the ISP perspective, it will help to focus on certain user groups and limit the peak load on their network',\n",

This class extends an existing piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functional in a way that the proposed Lyapunov function is an explicit function of the switching logic as well as the continuous state. Conservatism is thereby reduced in the new analysis approach using these Lyapunov functions because the analysis uses a more general class of Lyapunov functions than the previously published Popov/Yakubovich and piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. Furthermore, the derived analysis conditions can be cast as a semi-definite program (SDP), which can be efficiently solved using widely available software. Included are examples to show the effectiveness of this class of Lyapunov functional in analyzing relay control systems',\n",

       " 'Summary form only given. When sufficiently long optical pulses propagate through low loss optical fiber the temporal effects of linear dispersion can be neglected in modeling the propagation, and the dominant effects are nonlinear processes. This widely used approximation is called the quasi-continuous wave approximation since it eliminates any explicit reference to time in the propagation equations; this model is common in the study of stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) of long pulses in optical fiber. However, because SRS is intensity dependent, one expects the temporal shape of the pulses to influence the transfer of energy from the pump to the Stokes orders. We show here that the detailed temporal shape of the pulse is especially important at high pump powers where several Stokes orders are generated in the fiber. In particular, to achieve agreement between experiment and theory requires the inclusion of both the overall temporal shape of the pulse pulse envelope and the detailed structure for multi-mode pump pulses. We believe that this is the first detailed comparison of theory and experiment for strongly saturated SRS in optical fibers.',\n",

       " 'One of the most effective techniques for developing efficient isosurfacing algorithms is the reduction of visits to nonisosurface cells. Recent algorithms have drastically reduced the unnecessary cost of visiting nonisosurface cells. The experimental results show almost optimal performance in their isosurfacing processes. However, most of them have a bottleneck in that they require more than O(n) computation time for their preprocessing, where n denotes the total number of cells. We propose an efficient isosurfacing technique, which can be applied to unstructured as well as structured volumes and which does not require more than O(n) computation time for its preprocessing. A preprocessing step generates an extrema skeleton, which consists of cells and connects all extremum points, by the volume thinning algorithm. All disjoint parts of every isosurface intersect at least one cell in the extrema skeleton. Our implementation generates isosurfaces by searching for isosurface cells in the extrema skeleton and then recursively visiting their adjacent isosurface cells, while it skips most of the nonisosurface cells. The computation time of the preprocessing is estimated as O(n). The computation time of the isosurfacing process is estimated as O(n<sup>1/3</sup>m+k), where k denotes the number of isosurface cells and m denotes the number of extremum points since the number of cells in an extrema skeleton is estimated as O(n<sup>1/3</sup>m)',\n",

The result is a system that is simpler and more robust than a vision-only solution. However, the use of inertial rate sensors introduces several issues.

Finally, the impact of LNS on the hardware architecture and, thus, to power dissipation, is discussed.

Parallel beam collimators are widely used in different applications, because reconstruction is straightforward. Fan-beam collimators focus on a focal line parallel to the axis of rotation.

We propose a new, more sophisticated model for calculating the sensitivity of fan-beam collimation throughout the whole field of view of an Anger gamma camera and compare it with a previously published model. Projection measurements of a uniform flood source near the face of a fan-beam collimator demonstrate that this new model is more accurate.',\n",

In principle, it extracts the state of the traffic lights and vehicle motions without any physical or electronic interconnections to the traffic light control system or the buried loop detectors. Purely from the video, the new method first constructs a traffic light sequence and then it estimates vehicle motions beyond the stop line while the light is red. In the former, the spatial and temporal relationships of individual traffic lights are utilized. In the latter, the concept of virtual loop detector has been introduced to emulate the physical loop detectors. A prototype was implemented based on this method and was tested in a number of field trials. The results show that the new method is able to detect multiple red light runners in multiple lanes.

Copper electrodeposition has an advantage over aluminum physical deposition in its ability to allow superconformal deposition and 'superfilling' of trenches and vias in the Damascene process when additives (inhibitors, accelerators) are present in the plating bath. An additive formulation that has been shown to exhibit superfill contains NaCl, 3-mercapto-1propanesulfonate (MPSA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). However, although it is recognized that copper inhibition is essential to achieve superfill, the overall mechanism and role of each additive in achieving superfill is still under debate due to the lack of understanding these processes on the molecular level. Detailed analysis of vibrational spectra can provide information on the local order of the surface species and their orientation. We measured ex situ vibrationally resonant sum frequency generation (VR-SFG) spectra of MPSA self-assembled from a perchloric acid solution on both gold and copper substrates.

Pigtails using standard single mode fiber produce coupling loss on the order of 3 to 5 dB/connection. In order to improve mode size matching yet maintain low drive voltage, we incorporate waveguide and fibers tapers.

Conditions to ensure that a metric function is conflict-free have been presented in the literature.

       " 'New technology in digital excitation control provides a method to balance thyristor currents in parallel power rectifier bridges that provide current to a synchronous generator field. Balancing current between parallel bridges feeding a common load has traditionally been accomplished by using current balancing transformers in each bridge or adding inductance in series with the thyristors or SCRs (silicon controlled rectifiers). This paper introduces Active Current Balance, a new technique which modifies the average current in parallel leg thyristors to facilitate current balance between the bridges. This is accomplished by periodically inhibiting the firing of thyristors that carry more than the average current. The thyristors that are fired carry more current during this interval, increasing their average current. The thyristors that are not fired do not carry current during this interval and thus their average current is reduced. Using this technique (referred to in this paper as \"skip firing\"), the average current in parallel legs can be adjusted through feedback and control to equalize the average thyristor current loading. Additional feedback and control parameters are proposed, such as heatsink temperatures, which can be measured and utilized to program the \"skip firing,\" in order to balance thyristor heat-sink temperatures',\n",

With the help of a current sensing energy recovery circuit, the proposed current-driven synchronous rectifier can operate at high switching frequency with high efficiency. Compared with those voltage-driven synchronous rectification solutions, this current-driven synchronous rectifier has several outstanding characteristics. It can be easily applied to most switching topologies like an ideal diode. Constant gate drive voltage can be obtained regardless of line and load fluctuation. Converters designed with this synchronous rectifier are also capable of being connected in parallel without taking the risk of reverse power sinking. The principle of operation is given in the paper.

The hybrid converter is capable of annihilating current harmonics in the power system, while it functions as an AC to DC converter for a medium or large power rating DC load. In eliminating the harmonics with the proposed topology, the harmonic currents are divided into the converter and the passive filter, and a major portion of harmonics flows through the passive filter. Thus, the harmonic current load of the active switch is significantly reduced, and the harmonic elimination and the DC-link voltage regulation can be performed without using any additional major hardware nor increasing the current rating of the converter. The feasibility of the proposed hybrid PWM converter is confirmed by simulation',\n",
       " \"Duration Calculus (DC), an extension of interval temporal logic, has been shown very powerful and suitable for specifying multimedia protocols. Generally speaking, it is impossible to verify the DC specifications using model-checking because of DC's undecidability. H. Dierks (1999) presented an approach to solving the problem. The main contribution of this paper is improving H. Dierks's algorithm so that it can be used to transform the DC specification of multimedia protocols to the input of the model checker. The basic idea behind this work is that we use general DC to specify multimedia protocols, and the improved H. Dierks' algorithm to transform them to PLC-Automata, further to Timed Automata. Using model-checkers developed for TA, we can verify the correctness of protocols. We shall demonstrate it by Adaptive LSP. For convenience, we use more general forms of DC Implementables, but they can be reduced to the four standard forms given by H. Dierks.\",\n",

       " 'Wideband dielectric spectroscopy measurements (100 Hz to 10 GHz) were carried out on different microporous systems (including sintered glass filters, sandstone and carbonate rocks) saturated with brine (electrolytic water solution) and a hydrocarbon oil at different relative fractions. Three main contributions were singled out in the dielectric spectra: low frequency dispersion (LFD) effects (<100 kHz) related to long range ionic transport and dependent on the connectivity of the water phase; Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) polarization effects (100 kHz to 1 GHz), essentially controlled by the shape of the water inclusions; and high-frequency effects (>1 GHz) due to short-range ion transport and related to specific pore surface. For each analyzed system, oil-wet (o-W) and water-wet (w-w) samples were obtained by chemical treatment of the pore surfaces. Systematic differences were observed in the electrical response on varying wettability (and so the respective distribution of the fluids in the pore space). Parameters such as the loss tangent value, the strength and the exponent of the LFD power law, as well as the characteristic time and strength of the MWS relaxation were good indicators of wettability. Results were discussed by using some standard models that account for the pore wettability effects on dielectric spectra. A new method for wettability determination of reservoir rocks from both laboratory and borehole electric measurements was presented',\n",

       " 'We develop an empirical technique to determine the capacity of a mobile ad hoc network. We assume that the network runs on-demand routing and carrier sense-based medium access protocols. The technique, however, is general and should apply to other types of protocols. We develop a tool that determines the network capacity given session-level traffic and node mobility traces. We compare the network capacity so determined with the actual network utilization from output statistics generated by a comprehensive simulator. It is observed that network capacity increases with node mobility; but the routing and medium access protocols fail to take advantage of the increased capacity. Even with high loads, a significant portion of the network capacity is not utilized, while the routing performance remains poor. This study indicates that there is a significant scope for designing aggressive routing protocols that utilize the network capacity better to improve routing performance',\n",

       " 'Summary form only given. The gain spectrum of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is inhomogeneously broadened due to inevitable dot size fluctuations. If the homogeneous broadening is small, only QDs of the same size interact with each other via the photon field and lasing can occur on many wavelengths simultaneously. In this respect, the system QD/barrier material resembles a guest/host-system, much like titanium ions in a sapphire crystal. Therefore, QD lasers might be interesting candidates for mode locking. We investigate the lasing dynamics of an optically pumped gain-switched edge emitting QD laser at room temperature. The laser structure is a Fabry-Perot resonator of length L = 1.6 mm with cleaved uncoated end facets. The active material consists of 7 layers of InAs QDs embedded in GaAs and surrounded by an AlGaAs waveguide The GaAs surrounding the QDs is optically pumped with 100 fs pulses from a regenerative amplifier at an excitation wavelength of 800 nm. Lateral gain guiding is enforced by focussing the beam to a stripe of 100 /spl mu/m width, along the full length of the laser resonator.

       " 'Damascene metallization processes utilizing PVD seed and electroplated copper are demonstrating the capability to provide void free fill in sub 0.1 micron generation features. Ultimately, the extendibility of this metallization sequence is limited by the trade-off between pinch-off of very small features at higher PVD thickness, and the lack of seed coverage near the feature base at lower PVD thickness. When very thin PVD seeds are augmented by a conformal copper deposition process, the pinch-off and poor seed coverage issues which limit filling during bottom-up electrodeposition are potentially reduced, while the adhesion properties of PVD deposition are maintained. This paper presents a study of electrolytic and electroless seed repair in 6:1 aspect ratio 0.18 micron vias seeded with PVD thickness of 250-1500 A Cu. Filling performance and copper coverage in vias after seed repair were studied. Results suggest that PVD thickness in the range of 500 A can be combined with both electroless and electrolytic film thickness in the range of 200 A to improve overall fill performance.',\n",

This research builds on previously proposed extensions to the UML and moves a step closer to the goal of providing through-life engineering support to agent oriented systems development. This work is motivated by a pressing need to maintain, modify, develop and deploy existing and future agent based simulations of military operations for the Australian Defence Force',\n",

       " 'We simulate daily trading of straddles on financial indexes. The straddles are traded based on predictions of daily volatility differences in the indexes. The main predictive models studied are recurrent neural nets (RNN). Such applications have often been studied in isolation. However, due to the special character of daily financial time-series, it is difficult to make full use of RNN representational power. Recurrent networks either tend to overestimate noisy data, or behave like finite-memory sources with shallow memory; they hardly beat classical fixed-order Markov models. To overcome data nonstationarity, we use a special technique that combines sophisticated models fitted on a larger data set, with a fixed set of simple-minded symbolic predictors using only recent inputs. Finally, we compare our predictors with the GARCH family of econometric models designed to capture time-dependent volatility structure in financial returns. GARCH models have been used to trade volatility. Experimental results show that while GARCH models cannot generate any significantly positive profit, by careful use of recurrent networks or Markov models, the market makers can generate a statistically significant excess profit, but then there is no reason to prefer RNN over much more simple and straightforward Markov models. We argue that any report containing RNN results on financial tasks should be accompanied by results achieved by simple finite-memory sources combined with simple techniques to fight nonstationarity in the data',\n",

       " 'A new design methodology for the Cerebella Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) with the theory of variable structure system (VSS) is proposed in this paper. Variable structure system, also named as sliding mode control, is a powerful design method for controlling a nonlinear system where exists uncertainty. Generally speaking, the CMAC is first trained from an existed controller; then the CMAC can be used to instead of the original controller for achieving a fast operating system performance. Moreover, it can be easily realized through FPGA and operated in the requirement of real-time control cases. However, the overall performance of control system depends on the trained CMAC; usually, it is not easy to yield the same performance as the original controller. Therefore, how to improve the performance without learning process maybe is a good idea in designing the CMAC. The determination of the CMAC weights via the control scheme of VSS provides a solution for designing such controller. In addition, a constructed updating rule mechanism is used to enhance the characteristic of CMAC. Finally, a simulation example of controlling a nonlinear system is employed to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed control scheme.',\n",

In this iterated learning model (ILM), there is no biological evolution, natural selection, nor any measurement of the success of the agents at communicating (except for results-gathering purposes). Nevertheless, counter to intuition, significant evolution of linguistic behavior is observed. From an initially unstructured communication system (a protolanguage), a fully compositional syntactic meaning-string mapping emerges. Furthermore, given a nonuniform frequency distribution over a meaning space and a production mechanism that prefers short strings, a realistic distribution of string lengths and patterns of stable irregularity emerges, suggesting that the ILM is a good model for the evolution of some of the fundamental features of human language',\n",

The interleaving process is of the double byte kind.

A method based on a Kalman filter for a priori information estimation is described, where both inter- and intra-frame correlation are taken into account. It is shown that for the AMR codec, although highly optimized in exploiting signal redundancy, some redundancy still remains in the encoded speech bits. By using an optimized JSC decoding algorithm like the repeated decoding, a gain of up to 0.2 dB in channel signal-to-noise ratio is achievable, compared to decoding without exploiting the residual redundancy.

The factors effecting entrainment were further investigated using single-cell models paced with an artificial biphasic coupling current. Our simulation results suggest that dissimilar cell types, those with largely different upstroke velocities entrain more easily, that is, they require less coupling conductance to achieve 1:1 frequency entrainment.

FMM works with two images: the original image to be processed and a structuring element. However, the shape and value of structuring element must decide before image processing. Also, there is the problem that the image changes largely by the selection of the structuring element. In this paper, we propose a new filter to extract characteristics in an ambiguous image. First, the adaptive structuring elements (ASE) are defined. The ASE can be determined directly from the input image without any arbitrary choice, which is sensitive to ambiguous images. Next, we propose the dynamic fuzzy morphological filter (DFMF) with ASE. This method is useful for automatic inspection systems using image processing and effective to characteristics extraction. Performance evaluation via simulations shows that the DFMF efficiently extracts characteristics. Furthermore, the DFMF shows a good performance compared with the other filters',\n",

       " 'Traditional error diffusion halftoning is a high quality method for producing binary images from digital grayscale images. Error diffusion shapes the quantization noise power into the high frequency regions where the human eye is the least sensitive. Error diffusion may be extended to color images by using error filters with matrix-valued coefficients to take into account the correlation among color planes. For vector color error diffusion, we propose three contributions. First, we analyze vector color error diffusion based on a new matrix gain model for the quantizer, which linearizes vector error diffusion. The model predicts the key characteristics of color error diffusion, esp. image sharpening and noise shaping. The proposed model includes linear gain models for the quantizer by Ardalan and Paulos (1987) and by Kite et al. (1997) as special cases. Second, based on our model, we optimize the noise shaping behavior of color error diffusion by designing error filters that are optimum with respect to any given linear spatially-invariant model of the human visual system. Our approach allows the error filter to have matrix-valued coefficients and diffuse quantization error across color channels in an opponent color representation. Thus, the noise is shaped into frequency regions of reduced human color sensitivity. To obtain the optimal filter, we derive a matrix version of the Yule-Walker equations which we solve by using a gradient descent algorithm. Finally, we show that the vector error filter has a parallel implementation as a polyphase filterbank',\n",

In order to improve these features, object replication mechanisms have been introduced. Programming replication policies for a given application is not an easy task, and this is the reason why transparency for the programmer has been one of the most important properties offered by all replication models. However, this transparency for the programmer is not always desirable. In this paper we present a replication model, JReplica, based on Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). JReplica allows the separated specification of the replication code from the functional behaviour of objects, providing not only a high degree of transparency, as done by previous models, but also the possibility for programmers to introduce new behaviour to specify different fault tolerance requirements. Moreover, the replication aspect has been introduced at design time, and in this way, UML has been extended in order to consider replication issues separately when designing fault tolerance systems',\n",

During the digital rectal exam this can be used not only to detect the hypertrophy but also localized hardenings. The examination by digital palpation is inaccurate and even in combination with PSA-value and a transrectal ultrasonic examination the result is often not reliable. Ultrasound strain imaging is able to measure and visualize the elastic properties of a tissue region and hence is an adequate supplement for commonly used diagnostic procedures. We have developed a real time system for elastographic mechanical tissue assessment of the prostate which can be used for the transrectal ultrasonic examination for navigation and diagnosis. During the examination a sequence of ultrasonic images is acquired while the organ is slightly compressed by the ultrasound probe. Using a numerical analysis of image pairs of the acquired sequence the tissue strain is calculated which represents the spatial elasticity distribution of a specific cross-section of the organ and which are able to distinguish hard areas in the tissue. We present results from several patients which show that real time strain imaging is able to detect tumor-like areas which are inconspicuous in the b-mode image. The results correspond to the histological specimens.

       " 'Radio-frequency (RF) ablation is an important means of treatment of non-resectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. The RF ablation of any but the smallest tumor requires the use of multiple overlapping treatment zones. Commercially available RF ablation generators, unlike cryoablation (a method of tumor destruction that utilizes cold rather than heat), are only capable of driving a single RF probe at a time. Using multiple probes simultaneously in RF ablation is desirable for treating large tumors and for treating multiple tumor metastases. Bipolar RF ablation, which has been previously studied by other groups, allows simultaneous usage of two probes. The energy converted to heat at each probe for bipolar RF ablation is necessarily equal. There have been no investigations of other methods that allow usage of multiple RF probes simultaneously. We investigated the feasibility of a new method, where power is applied in an alternating fashion between two or more probes. This method allows independent control of the amount of energy deposited at each probe. We performed ex-vivo experiments with one (i.e. conventional ablation) and with two probes. In the two-probe experiment, both probes reached target temperature and created lesions of sizes comparable to conventional RF ablation.',\n",
       " \"Strain imaging can derive clinically important information regarding tissue elasticity. In relatively incompressible materials (such as tissue), a strain in one direction is accompanied by strain of opposite polarity in one or more orthogonal directions. When a regular ultrasound array - long in the azimuth and narrow in elevation - is pressed into soft tissue one expects the primary Poisson ratio related strain to be in the elevation direction. One objective is to determine whether the resultant 'y' strained image is distinguishable from the unstrained case. A second objective is to compare the degree of decorrelation due to elevation strain with that due to small, practically unavoidable, elevational translational offsets. Hence, it is necessary to model full 3D strain effects on speckle. Our conclusion from initial analysis of the impact of elevational strain on 2D speckle patterns is that the associated decorrelation is very small. Consequently, any small elevational translation that occurs during the strain application process will have a dominant effect on the net 2D image decorrelation\",\n",
       " 'The issue logic of a dynamically-scheduled superscalar processor is a complex mechanism devoted to start the execution of multiple instructions every cycle. Due to its complexity, it is responsible for a significant percentage of the energy consumed by a microprocessor. The energy consumption of the issue logic depends on several architectural parameters, the instruction issue queue size being one of the most important. In this paper we present a technique to reduce the energy consumption of the issue logic of a high-performance superscalar processor. The proposed technique is based on the observation that the conventional issue logic wastes a significant amount of energy for useless activity. In particular, the wake-up of empty entries and operands that are ready represents an important source of energy waste. Besides, we propose a mechanism to dynamically reduce the effective size of the instruction queue. We show that on average the effective instruction queue size can be reduced by a factor of 26% with minimal impact on performance. This reduction together with the energy saved for empty and ready entries result in about 90.7% reduction in the energy consumed by the wake-up logic, which represents 14.9% of the total energy of the assumed processor',\n",

Forces exerted on the tissue are often small and should be reflected back amplified to the surgeon. The dynamic behavior of a telemanipulator system can be adjusted in three basic ways to guarantee sufficient stability robustness in spite of high force scaling factors: by scaling down the surgeon's input motion, by increasing the compliance at the slave arm, and/or by increasing the motion resistance at the master arm. More \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransparent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d telemanipulator dynamics can be achieved when the damping provided by the surgeon's hand-arm-system is taken into account (for example, the motion resistance necessary to guarantee stability robustness can be reduced). This paper investigates the effect of the three basic types of telemanipulator dynamics on operator performance in surgical tasks. The impact of improving transparency by making use of operator damping is also studied. Three experiments imitating elementary surgical procedures were conducted: inserting a catheter tip into a vessel, puncturing a membrane, and detecting differences in tissue hardness through palpation. Subjects exerted significantly higher forces when inserting a catheter without force feedback, which shows the benefit of force feedback in surgical telemanipulation. Performance of the subjects was also greatly influenced by the basic type of telemanipulator dynamics. However, differences in outcome between the experiments indicate that the best basic type will generally depend on the surgical task at hand. Improving the transparency of the telemanipulator system by making use of operator damping did not improve performance of the subjects any further. Thus, it appears that providing the appropriate basic type of telemanipulator dynamics for a given task may be even more critical to the performance of the surgeon than an optimized transparency of the teleman- pulator dynamics.\",\n",

From a simple model the relevant parameters determining the spatial resolution are identified as the anode gap, the anode field, the end-spoiling penetration depth, and the channel diameter. These parameters are varied in a Monte-Carlo simulation in which 20\\xe2\\x80\\x89000 electrons are traced through a channel, the end-spoiling, and the anode gap. The spatial resolution as obtained from these simulations is shown to depend heavily on the nonuniform field at the end spoiling. Especially low-energy electrons generated at the end spoiling deteriorate the spatial resolution. The best resolution is obtained for a small anode gap (300 \\xce\\xbcm) and small anode voltage (3 kV). This indicates that, above a certain value of the electric field in the anode gap, the effect of the lens is dominant. Doubling the end-spoiling penetration depth from 10 to 20 \\xce\\xbcm increases the resolution especially at high spatial frequencies. Furthermore, the resolution is enhanced considerably by decreasing the channel diameter. These results can be fully understood from the simple model presented. In addition, results are presented from experiments in which the spatial resolution is measured for various anode gaps and anode voltages. The dependencies of the spatial resolution on these parameters are in good qualitative agreement with the simulation results. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Vacuum Society.',\n",

Object-based technologies are used to design applications and enhance the interoperability among applications. In addition to realizing the interoperability, the system is required to be secure. The secure system is required to not only protect objects from illegal manipulation but also illegal information flow among objects.

       " 'Due to ever-increasing bandwidth demands in future wireless service, the radio frequency band becomes more and more invaluable. In this paper, we address channel equalization for bandwidth-efficient wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM). First, we show that in order to be free of both interchannel interference and interblock interference, wireless OFDM has to occupy a bandwidth wider than the Nyquist rate and use insufficient statistics in symbol demodulation. Thus, the conventional OFDM gains computational efficiency using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) in demodulation at the cost of low efficiency of bandwidth usage and degradation in symbol error performance. Then we consider the OFDM that achieves high efficiency of bandwidth usage, allows interchannel interference and interblock interference to exist, and uses sufficient statistics in symbol demodulation. A one-tap decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed for equalization of the bandwidth efficient OFDM system. Simulation and numerical evaluation for an indoor wireless asynchronous transfer mode network are carried out. It is demonstrated that though occupying a narrower bandwidth, the one-tap DFE-based bandwidth-efficient OFDM system achieves lower symbol error rate and higher mutual information than the conventional DFT-based OFDM system. The proposed OFDM system presents a monotonically increasing symbol error rate, and convex-down achieved mutual information with respect to increasing efficiency of bandwidth usage',\n",

From the electroluminescence spectra measured at various temperatures, it is found that there are two peaks at about 400 and 460 nm, which can be assigned as Mg-related and quantum well transitions, respectively. The behavior of these two peaks with temperature is modeled by the two rate equation.

Many classic after-effects demonstrate the striking changes in perceived color, form and motion that can result from only brief exposures to simple adapting patterns.

We have examined the states of adaptation induced by the properties of the natural visual environment, and show that they can profoundly affect many natural visual tasks, from color perception to face recognition to the perception of image blur. These sensitivity adjustments are an intrinsic part of the visual response to any stimulus, and presumably functions to match visual coding to the current characteristics of the world.

In this study, we expand upon this observation to correlate fatigue rates more completely with respect to composition, orientation, temperature, and electric field strength. It is inferred that an engineered domain state in relaxor based ferroelectric crystals with the spontaneous polarization inclined to the normal of the electrode is associated with negligible or no fatigue at room temperature. However, if thermal history, temperature, or field strength induces a phase transition that produces a polarization parallel to the normal of electrode, these orientations fatigue. The relative fatigue rates are also studied as a function of temperature. In directions, such as <equation>[111]<sub>C</sub></equation> in the ferroelectric rhombohedral phase, the polarization fatigues at room temperature, but as temperature is increased the fatigue rate systematically decreases. This is explained in terms of a thermally activated process that limits the net fatigue rate of ferroelectrics. In summary, this article gives information on the polarization states and orientation that control fatigue in ferroelectric crystals with a relaxor end member. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.\",\n",

Monte Carlo simulation was used to calculate the escape probability as a function of the birth position of emitted beta particle for geometry of rhodium-based SPNDs. A simple numerical method calculated the initial generation rate of beta particles and the change of generation rate due to rhodium burnup. Using results of the simulation and the simple numerical method, the burnup profile of rhodium number density and the neutron sensitivity were calculated as a function of burnup time in reactors. This method was verified by the comparison of this and other papers, and data of YGN3.4 (Young Gwang Nuclear plant 3, 4) about the initial sensitivity. In addition, for improvement of some properties of rhodium-based SPNDs, which are currently used, a modified geometry is proposed. The proposed geometry, which is tube-type, is able to increase the initial sensitivity due to increase of the escape probability. The escape probability was calculated by changing the thickness of the insulator and compared solid-type with tube-type about each insulator thickness.

Compact all solid state lasers play a crucial role in the applications such as cost effective reliable laser radars and laser range finders for smart munitions where precision, light-weight, low power consumption, and ruggedness must be achieved simultaneously. For many applications it is desirable to have powerful nanosecond pulses which can be obtained by using Q-switching. Passive Q-switching with saturable absorbers has the advantage of ruggedness, simplicity, and good control of transverse mode. However, saturable absorber suffers from higher intra-cavity losses and, especially, the timing jitter. This is caused by the fluctuations within the system, such as temperature, pump power and wavelength, and the intra-cavity loss, etc. A number of jitter-reduction scheme involving combination of active-passive Q-switching have been proposed, but all of the schemes involved a large number of additional optical elements and the reduction. in jitter was not substantial. We have proposed and demonstrated a simple way to reduce timing jitter of a passively Q-switched laser with composite pumping pulse, which is composed of a long and low-power pulse and a short and high-power pulse.

The dielectric constant as a function of thickness was fitted, using the series capacitor model, for BST thicknesses greater than 70 nm.

Modeled consideration of the dielectric behavior for BST films, whose total thickness was below that of the dead layer, predicted anomalies in the plots of <equation>d/\\xce\\xb5</equation> against d at the dead-layer thickness. In the capacitors studied here, no anomaly was observed. Hence, either (i) 7.5 nm is an upper limit for the total dead-layer thickness in the SRO/BST/Au system, or (ii) dielectric collapse is not associated with a distinct interfacial dead layer, and is instead due to a through-film effect. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.\",\n",

       " \"Mobile agents is an important enabling technology for certain types of real world applications such as e-commerce and workflows. While the potential benefits are appealing, this technology is not being used by many applications. This is largely attributed to the lack of components such as transactions and their integration with de-facto technologies. This work focuses on bridging this gap and devising an extended transactional model for mobile agents. The nature of mobile agents for autonomous processing and mobility introduces numerous challenges with respect to transactions which are originally, addressed in our work. First, given that, unstructured, execution scripts for agents, it is necessary to isolate side-effects that occur between two successive migrations to later be able to commit or abort them locally according to transaction semantics maintained across multiple hosts. Second, intra-transaction parallelism requires synchronization among multiple autonomous agents to join their processing and to rollback a transaction. Third, recovery from failures at a specific host, may necessitate maintaining a global state of a transaction across all the agent's destinations to determine how to proceed (e.g., repeat activities upon recovery). This paper presents a comprehensive transaction model for mobile agents and its deployment in the context of Java-based mobile agents. The overall complexity of transaction management is handled using a division of labor between an object-oriented programming model, protocols and a concurrency control mechanism. Specifically, the programming model maintains separation of concerns between mobility, transactions and application logic in order to cope with the aforementioned challenges\",\n",

By redesign of existing models for distributed use, the IIOP (Internet Inter-ORB Protocol) architecture provides general access across the Internet; the methods are replicable with many different types of physiological models that produce a variety of results. This paper defines and explains the complete architecture for the user interface, the model encapsulation, and the communication layer between the client and server by developing a general example. Using the equivalent of interactive browsers to access remote models and display the results, the IIOP architecture is built up using platform-independent technology such as CORBA, Java and XML. The existing physiological models are first encapsulated by a suitable software language respect to the legacy models. Then CORBA IDL-XML interfaces are built accordingly as a broker interface connecting user interfaces to encapsulating interfaces. Therefore, the standard user interfaces on the browsers are easily built to access these models through the CORBA ORB and the encapsulating interfaces. This interface software is capable of interpreting and displaying very high-level descriptors and model output such that the amount of data required to be transmitted over the Internet is reduced.',\n",

       " \"Summary form only given. The detailed evolution of each exploding wire comprising a cylindrical array determines the energy and power densities ultimately achievable in a z-pinch implosion of the array. Presumably, once the relationship between exploding wire evolution and z-pinch dynamics is understood sufficiently, one could design a z-pinch experiment that would produce the optimum behavior for a given application. Before attempting to team how exploding wire evolution affects z-pinch behavior it is crucial to be able to accurately model the single exploding wire. Toward that end we have been doing single-exploding-wire simulations in the z-r plane with the MHD code MACH2 and with Sandia's new code ALEGRA. We have so far limited our study to the radial evolution. Our standard configuration corresponds to recent, well diagnosed exploding aluminum wire experiments from Cornell (Sinars et al., 2000). Simulations show that the path in phase space that an exploding wire takes in its evolution from solid metal to high-temperature plasma is quite sensitive to the EOS and conductivity models used. We have been guided by comparing the simulations with the Cornell data while maintaining as a constraint the consistency of our models with known EOS and conductivity data (DeSilva and Katsouros, 1998) from independent experiments and with modern physical descriptions appropriate in the parameter regime of the metal-insulator transition (Desjarlais, 2001). A novel view of exploding wires allows us to see graphically the mutual relations between the EOS and the electrical conductivity during the exploding wire's evolution. A key feature that occurs under certain conditions, as observed in experiments, is the transition to a coronal state (most current flowing through the rapidly-expanding low-density ionized vapor at large radius); a rapid transition coincides with a voltage collapse. How wire current, dI/dt, wire material, wire diameter, initial density profile, and initial - ire temperature affect the wire evolution will also be discussed.\",\n",
       " \"The Intelligent Systems Laboratory (ISL) has been developing coordinated control technologies for multitelerobot collaboration, in a common environment remotely controlled from multiple operators physically at a distance from each other. We have built a test bed and conducted a series of experiments, where we learned more about how the transmission delay over the network deteriorates the performance of telerobots. Previously, to overcome the problems arising from the throughput of the network such as the operator's delayed visual perception, we have suggested several coordination approaches in the local operator site. Likewise, this paper discusses the use of virtual repulsive force field in the online predictive simulator to assist the operator to cope with the collision between telerobots in remote environments. In the test bed, the operators control their master robot to get remote telerobots to work cooperatively with the other telerobots in a task. Specifically, the operator detects a priori the possibility of collision in the predictive simulator that runs in near real-time and the use of virtual force field prevents the telerobots from coming into collision. We have demonstrated various tasks by two telerobots and two operators via an Ethernet local area network (LAN) subject to simulated communication delays and evaluated the validity of the virtual force field guided approach in multi-operator-multi-robot (MOMR) tele-collaboration.\",\n",

However, it is desirable to describe the class of optical mappings and calculate the lens profiles for a more general case when incoming and outgoing wavefronts have arbitrary shapes.

It is shown that this mapping may be chosen freely and be used for various purposes such as satisfying Abbe's sine law or Herscel's condition exactly.

X-ray radiation energy of E/spl sim/1.8 MJ and a power of W/spl sim/290 TW was reached at the PBFA-Z facility at a current of J/spl sim/22 MA and implosion time of /spl tau//spl sim/120 ns using a two-cascade (nested) liner system. At present, explosive current opening switches are at /spl tau//spl sim/400 ns, and MCG breaking current value is J/spl sim/35 MA. Semiempirical models describing explosive current opening switches, are created and calibrated to the data from /spl sim/40 explosive experiments. Based on present information, it is feasible that the DFCG-480-10 disk generator operating with an explosive opening switch could produce a /spl sim/60 MA current into a 20 nH load with a rise time /spl tau//spl sim/400 ns. With this type of configuration, an estimated soft X-ray radiation energy of >10 MJ and power of >500 TW could be obtained. A program aimed at the creation of a high-power x-ray radiation source with the above mentioned parameters is presented. The level of accessible energies and X-ray radiation power is estimated at each stage using semi-empirical models of explosive opening switches operation and a description of the liner system dynamics in the framework of a thin shell model.',\n",

Optimal trajectories of this finite horizon problem (and hence the infinite horizon problem) are shown to always exist and to be somewhat regular.

Conventional slant correction techniques estimate the average slant angle of component characters and then correct the slant uniformly. Thus these conventional techniques will perform successfully under the assumption that each word is written with a constant slant.

In this paper, a nonuniform slant correction technique is presented where the slant correction problem is formulated as an optimal estimation problem of local slant angles at all horizontal positions. The optimal estimation is governed by a criterion function and several constraints for the global and local validity of the local angles. The optimal local slant angles which maximize the criterion satisfying the constraints are searched for efficiently by a dynamic programming based algorithm.

We show that, in general, widely linear approximation is superior to strictly linear approximation, unless the vector to be approximated is proper, in which case the optimum procedure is strictly linear. We analyze the case where the approximated random vector becomes proper in its internal coordinate system. This class of random vector, which we call generalized proper, possesses qualities similar to proper random vectors.',\n",
       " 'A frequency response device has been designed and built based on previous efforts by Y. Yasuda, L. C. V. Rees, F. Meunier, and Ph. Grenier. This design uses the best attributes of the three previous devices and is improved in five specific ways. First, the device makes use of the fast response capacitance manometer. Second, the device uses a servomotor to push and pull a metal bellows pump, which drives the sinusoidal input function, removing the chance of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfloating\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the bellows. Third, both sinusoidal and step-change volume perturbations can be studied. Fourth, the overall cost of the device was kept below $30\\xe2\\x80\\x89000. Finally, the pressure transducer is mounted only 8 cm from the sample, instead of \\xe2\\x88\\xbc30 cm, thus removing any averaging of the pressure signal at higher frequencies. The device is currently capable of measuring frequencies between 0.005 and 5 Hz, a range of three full orders of magnitude. The system can operate at temperatures between room temperature and 473 K and pressures between 0.3 and 300 Torr. Two systems were used to test the device, n-hexane/silicalite and methanol/silicalite. The model developed by Yasuda is used to analyze the frequency response of these systems. This model can describe a system as having more than one diffusivity and accounts for the presence of a surface resistance to diffusion. The results for n-hexane/silicalite and methanol/silicalite are compared to those of van den Begin and Nayak, respectively, and are in good agreement. Also, the diffusivities measured using this device are comparable to those estimated in 1997 by Rees using the frequency response method. In addition to measuring the diffusion rate processes, the kinetic parameters associated with a surface resistance to diffusion were also estimated. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.',\n",
       " 'This paper proposes a novel information theoretic approach to self-organization, called cooperative information control. The method aims to mediate between competition and cooperation among neurons by controlling the information content in neurons. Competition is realized by maximizing the information content in neurons. In the process of information maximization, only a small number of neurons win the competition, while all the others are inactive. Cooperation is implemented by having neurons behave similarly to their neighbors. These two processes are unified and controlled in the framework of cooperative information control. We applied the new method to linguistic analyses. In the analyses, experimental results confirmed that competition and cooperation are flexibly controlled. In addition, controlled processes can yield a number of different neuron firing patterns, which can be used to detect macro as well as micro features in input patterns',\n",

This paper presents an experimental study on the erosion of relay contacts tested in commercial devices under representative load conditions. The erosion measurement of relay contacts has been shown to be difficult since the standard method based on a mass change cannot be easily used in this type of device. The reason for this is that the contacts cannot be separated from the contact support. In the past, SEM studies have been used for rough estimates of erosion. More recently, noncontact laser measurement systems have been developed and used in this application for measurement of the volumetric erosion. In this study, using the method of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdesign of experiments,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a number of variables have been investigated, which include electrical current levels, material composition, and contact switching life.

       " 'With the increased pressure of better management of our dwindling resources, image fusion of data originating from different sensors and/or at different scales offer great potential. The methodology for scaling the individual data sets up or down is of major importance for image fusion of multiple resolution data. In this study the relationship between two multi-spectral data sets acquired at different resolutions (50 cm and 1 m nominal resolution) over the same area using the ADAR System 1000 is examined. Researchers often simulate coarser resolution data by averaging resolution cells over a given distance from a centre point. This is assumed to be an approximation to the actual point spread function of a sensor element, which is dependent on the sensor characteristics. To examine the spatial relationship between the two data sets the point spread function of the sensor is investigated by extracting a number of individual coarse scale elements and an array of fine scale resolution elements of varying size, centred at the position of the coarse scale element. A non-linear regression fitted to these data indicates the relative contribution of the fine scale resolution elements to the coarse scale data value. The results demonstrate that upscaling for this sensor must be based on weighted averaging over a much larger area than the coarse resolution cell indicates',\n",

       " 'The Joint UHF MILSATCOM Technical Working Group (TWG) is in the process of developing a single integrated waveform with the goal of providing a significant improvement over the two current demand-assigned multiple access (DAMA) waveforms. This paper describes key features and benefits of the waveform under development and describes several suggestions for improving the waveform that the authors believe should be considered by the TWG. Suggested improvements include a proposed alternative to the various data structures for control channel orderwire bursts, and protocol improvements that would reduce slot-conflict problems for half-duplex terminals, provide a mechanism to accommodate operation over multiple satellites in the same coverage area, provide more effective methods for satellite range determination, and reduce network overhead by including terminal status within ranging bursts sent by terminals. The integrated waveform (IW) will extend the slave channel concept introduced by MIL-STD-188-183A by transmitting forward orderwire (FOW) bursts on selected control channels while user communication can be allocated to any available satellite channel. By eliminating the predefined time-slot frame formats used by MIL-STD-188-183, and by using the multi-h continuous phase modulation (CPM) developed for MIL-STD-188-181B, the IW can more than double the number of circuits that the existing satellite constellation can support. To gain user support, however, the IW has to do more than just increase the number of available services; it must also make communications easier and more reliable. The current DAMA waveforms already greatly increase the number of circuits that UHF SATCOM can support, but that capacity increase has not resulted in tremendous user support for DAMA. Without user acceptance, the IW will not be able to achieve the capacity increase that it is capable of providing.',\n",

However, there seems to be no let-up in standardization skullduggery by others. As you may recall, a jury in Richmond, Virginia, found that Rambus, with the aid of a mysterious informant designated Secret Squirrel, defrauded the JEDEC Solid State Technology Association (formerly, the Joint Electronic Devices Engineering Council) and, the dynamic RAM industry. Infineon had alleged that Rambus, manipulated its claims in pending patent applications to cover the evolving JEDEC standards on single-data-rate (SDR) and double-data-rate (DDR) synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) chips. After JEDEC issued the patents and published the standards, Rambus demanded that SDRAM manufacturers take high-priced licenses under the patents. Patent infringement litigation followed when three manufacturers (Infineon, Micron, and Hyundai), refused to take licenses. Infineon's case went to trial first, which led to the fraud verdict. Rambus filed papers with the court explaining why it was not guilty of fraud and asking the court to overturn the verdict and enter in its favor a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL).

We hypothesized that following successful physical rehabilitation, people with cerebellar degeneration will have a faster rate of decay of the COP response to an external perturbation. Because the COP is modulated by a synergy of trunk and lower limb motion strategies, COP decay rate may be a useful measure of lower limb coordination in people with cerebellar ataxia.

It is argued that most people do not consider the direction in which society is developing, simply allowing it to go on blindly, but that the risks that result from this are greater than ever and threaten the very existence of mankind. There are two basic problems to be solved; what has caused these problems and how they be solved, and whether, if solutions exist, they are compatible with humankind's happiness. Both of these problems must be analyzed based upon the careful analysis of human nature. This paper first discusses the problem of what aspect of human nature is relevant to the ceaseless increase of energy use and how such aspects can be utilized to evade the problem. The analysis of the human feeling of happiness will then be presented to examine if the life of decreased use of energy is compatible with human nature\",\n",

The model relies on two parameters related to the mean specific opacity of the plasma and the optical transmission of the ablating vapor layer. Experiments were performed with cableguns identical to those used for plasma injection into the DECADE plasma opening switch. Two laser interferometer beams placed 2.5 and 5.0 cm downstream of the nozzle exit provided radial scans of the electron number density and a measure of the plasma velocity in the ejected plasma. The time dependent radial profiles of the number density, the plasma velocity, the plasma temperature and the measured mass ablated from the cableguns were used to select values for the unknown model parameters. Comparisons of code predictions with the line-integrated electron number density and with electron number density obtained from Abel inverted interferometer data show good agreement. The code and the data both exhibit the oscillating density and spread in the ejected plasma caused by the oscillating current from the underdamped LRC driving circuit.',\n",

Each sector covers a street block with a base station located at an intersection, and an intelligent beam-switching scheme is used to locate mobile users in the most suitable beam coverage. Due to directional narrow-beam patterns and waveguide effects of tall buildings, radio signals along vertical and horizontal streets do not interfere with each other. Therefore, a channel can be reused simultaneously in multiple neighboring cells as long as cochannels do not encounter each other along the line of sight. The proposed scheme has a channel reuse efficiency of 0.95 for a traffic load of 0.02 [new-call arrivals/s/cell].

Based on a probabilistic interpretation of FLL, the paper proposes a hybrid learning scheme for FLL modeling, which uses a modified adaptive spline modeling (MASMOD) algorithm to construct the antecedent parts (membership functions) in the FLL model, and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to parameterize the consequent parts (local linear models). The hybrid method not only has an approximation ability as good as most neuro-fuzzy network models, but also produces a parsimonious network structure (gain from MASMOD) and provides covariance information about the model error (gain from EM) which is valuable in applications such as state estimation and control.

We demonstrate that LPC cepstral coefficients have the desired features for accurate clustering and efficient indexing of ARIMA time series. For example, just a few LPC cepstral coefficients are sufficient in order to discriminate between time series that are modeled by different ARIMA models. In fact, this approach requires fewer coefficients than traditional approaches, such as DFT (discrete Fourier transform) and DWT (discrete wavelet transform). The proposed distance measure can be used for measuring the similarity between different ARIMA models as well. We cluster ARIMA time series using the \"partition around medoids\" method with various similarity measures. We present experimental results demonstrating that, using the proposed measure, we achieve significantly better clusterings of ARIMA time series data as compared to clusterings obtained by using other traditional similarity measures, such as DFT, DWT, PCA (principal component analysis), etc. Experiments were performed both on simulated and real data',\n",

Detailed analysis of the annealing data at zero and reverse bias shows that annealing rates are independent of the defect charge state or this defect interacts with the two bands, i.e., is a recombination center trapping alternatively an electron, then a hole. An experiment based on minority carrier capture on a majority trap by the double carrier pulse DLTS technique further supports the evidence that H2 has a large minority carrier capture cross section and is an efficient nonradiative recombination center. Recombination-enhanced defect annealing rates obeys a simple Arrhenius law with an activation enthalpy of 0.51\\xc2\\xb10.09 eV, in contrast to athermal processes observed in GaP. Detailed analysis of results reveals that the mechanism involved in the minority carrier injection annealing of the H2 defect is energy release mechanism in which enhancement is induced by the energy which is released when a minority carrier is trapped on the defect site. Finally, analysis of the depth profiles data relates that H2 acts as a donor, which partially compensates the acceptors. \\xc2\\xa9 2001 American Institute of Physics.',\n",

The thin dielectric layer model shows, that for rough tubes there is exactly one synchronous mode, the so called \"rough tube mode\" (normally in the THz region), which couples to the beam. The existence of this mode was proven by 2D and 3D simulations. In 2D the surface roughness is represented by irises. For a special kind of such 2D roughness, namely rectangular irises with random width and distance, there exists an easy way to explicitly calculate their equivalent dielectric properties. Equipped with these we calculate the wave number of the rough tube mode and contrast it to the wave number of the thin dielectric layer mode. In doing so, we present for this geometry a consistent mathematical formulation of rough surface wake fields. In 3D simulations the surface roughness is represented by randomly distributed obstacles. We show two simulations with few obstacles. In one case the wake field turns out to be mainly inductive, whereas in the other case we find again the rough tube mode',\n",

       " 'This paper proposes a novel current transformer (CT) saturation detecting algorithm unaffected by a remanent flux. At the instants of the beginning/end of saturation, the magnetizing inductance of the core changes significantly, resulting in severe wave distortion of the secondary current. In other words, although the secondary current is continuous, the shape of the secondary current during saturation is quite different from that during unsaturation after a fault. In addition to that, at the instants, the increment of the secondary current is reduced significantly, depending on a remanent flux and saturation time. The third difference of the secondary current is used to detect CT saturation in this paper. That is, if the third difference is less than a predetermined threshold value, the CT saturation is at the instant of beginning or end. The proposed method does not depend on the amount of a remanent flux and any frequency components contained in the current. The results of various tests with a remanent flux from -80% to +80% indicate satisfactory performance of the method',\n",

We are particularly interested in measuring their acquisition of three EC-2000 outcomes: teamwork, communications and problem solving skills. To do this, we have utilized multi-source feedback in conjunction with closed-form attitudinal surveys as part of a study to measure outcomes through triangulation. In this paper, we discuss our use of multi-source feedback in the classroom and compare the results that we have obtained to results obtained from the attitudinal surveys. We also present those effects we have found that may be due to differences in gender and learning styles. Specifically, our experiment involves following two cohorts of approximately 50 students each through a three-course sequence in industrial engineering that spans the third, fourth and fifth semesters. Outcome measurements are obtained using two assessment methods-multi-source feedback via the Team Developer<sup>TM</sup> and closed-form questionnaires via the Pittsburgh Sophomore/Junior Engineering Learning and Curriculum Evaluation Instruments and the Pittsburgh Senior Exit Survey. In addition, we have further enhanced information about student teams with a short survey that assesses overall team maturity and performance, as well as obtains students' perceptions about the overall learning environment\",\n",

The transmission control protocol (TCP), the dominant protocol for end-to-end reliable data transmission will naturally be broadly used in mobile wireless systems and especially over UMTS. However UMTS also implements its own retransmission mechanism via the radio link control (RLC) protocol that is likely to compete with TCP's. The influence of different RLC parameters has been investigated in order to assess the benefits of the link layer ARQ scheme for different situations. The conducted simulations aim at finding the ideal RLC set of parameters for a TCP based application.

Recently there has been interest in the use of chip-equalizers before despreading in order to restore the orthogonality of the transmitted sequences at the receiver. However, the issue of adapting these equalizers fast enough to track a wideband fading channel is still an open problem. In this paper we first show that if the optimal MMSE equalizer taps for a pilot sequence are used for equalizing other users, the MSE performance is very close to that obtained by using the optimal taps for that user, i.e. the equalizer taps that are optimal for the pilot sequence are, when multiplied by a gain factor, close to optimal for any other user in the system. We then go on to show that a DS-CDMA system that uses multiple pilot sequences can very effectively track fast-fading channel variations using least-squares adaptation on the known pilot sequences',\n",

Though the standard RLS algorithm has an implicit weight decay term in its energy function, the weight decay effect decreases linearly as the number of learning epochs increases, thus rendering a diminishing weight decay effect as training progresses. In this paper, we derive two modified RLS algorithms to tackle this problem. In the first algorithm, namely, the true weight decay RLS (TWDRLS) algorithm, we consider a modified energy function whereby the weight decay effect remains constant, irrespective of the number of learning epochs. The second version, the input perturbation RLS (IPRLS) algorithm, is derived by requiring robustness in its prediction performance to input perturbations. Simulation results show that both algorithms improve the generalization capability of the trained network',\n",

When an excited atom is placed in a small reflecting cavity, it is only allowed to radiate into the discrete set of electromagnetic modes that satisfy the boundary conditions in the cavity. If none of these modes are compatile with the spontaneous emission modes of the atom, it will not emit radiation. This phenomenon, known as \"inhibited spontaneous emission,\" has been observed for atoms, for trapped electrons, and for a special type of light source called a parametric downconverter (PDC), in which an incident \"pump\" photon can spontaneously decay into a pair of lower-energy \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons.

For field strengths of the order of mc/sup 2///spl lambda/e, which for /spl lambda/=1 /spl mu/m corresponds to an intensity of the order of 2/spl times/10/sup 17/ W/cm/sup 2/, the electron is accelerated to relativistic velocities in a single optical period, and thus the excursion of the electron from its equilibrium position occurs over a distance of the order of /spl lambda/. Under such conditions, the radiation emitted by the electron cannot be described within the electric dipole approximation, and in fact cannot be well described by a multipole expansion for a finite number of terms. We instead calculate the intensity of the emitted radiation through the use of the Lenard-Wiechert potentials.',\n",

High-current radiating discharges for optical pumping of gas lasers are usually formed in electrode longitudinal configurations with supplying by means of capacitive storages of energy. In the present report the results of research an original azimuthal discharge, pressed to inner wall of a cylindrical dielectric chamber by pressure of a trapped longitudinal magnetic field are informed. To form the azimuthal discharge a three-winding three-layer solenoid, which simultaneously was an inductive storage of energy was applied. The current supplying of the inductive storage was carried out with the help of a primary capacitive storage with energetic capacity of 60 kJ at charging voltage of 50 kV. An electroexplosive foil opening switch was applied as a current breaker of the inductive storage. At the moment of a maximum charging current a near-wall plasma winding was created by excitation of a longitudinal creeping discharge. The electrical explosion of an aluminum foil in this moment resulted in trapping of longitudinal magnetic field by azimuthal plasma current in volume of the discharge chamber with a diameter of 10 cm and dissipating of external magnetic field energy. In the further the supporting of azimuthal current was carried out at the expense of trapped magnetic field energy. The maximum brightness temperature of the plasma layer reached 4 eV. In the report the results of research of dynamics and radiative properties of a plasma layer are adduced.',\n",

Our experiments show that the (iterated) Sturm-Triggs approach often fails for linear camera motions. In addition, we study experimentally the common situation where the calibration is fixed and approximately known, comparing the projective versions of our algorithms to mixed projective/Euclidean strategies. We clarify the nature of dominant-plane compensation, showing that it can be considered a small-translation approximation rather than an approximation that the scene is planar.
